Causal Exploration: The finding of 'atelectasis' was diagnosed in the 'Parenchyme' and 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)' with the location information provided. This is potentially caused by an abnormality in lung volume expansion, as indicated in the statement "When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other." Atelectasis can lead to one lung not expanding fully, resulting in it not being prominently larger than the other.
