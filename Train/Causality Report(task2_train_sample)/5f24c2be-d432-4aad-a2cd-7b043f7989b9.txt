In A4, the term 'pleural effusion' is relevant to the part in A5 where it states, "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting."

A causal statement could be: 

"Causal Exploration: The blunting of the costophrenic angles, discovered during the tracing of the lateral margins of the lung, indicates the presence of pleural effusion. This can be due to various causes such as heart failure, pneumonia, or malignancies. The finding of 'pleural effusion', designated as A1, was located in either 'Pleural', 'Left Pleural', or it was not specified (A2). The specific location information of the finding was between the third and eleventh words in the analyzed document (A3). Therefore, the observation of the 'pleural effusion' (A4) and the blunting of the costophrenic angles are causally related findings."
