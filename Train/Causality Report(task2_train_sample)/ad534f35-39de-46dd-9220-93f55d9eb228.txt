Causal Exploration: The detection of a 'nodule' (A1) in the 'Parenchyme' and 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)' (A2) could be due to an abnormally increased density area identified in the apical, upper, middle and lower zones. This was found at a specific location in the scan (A3). The 'nodule' might be the cause of this abnormal increase in density. Further investigation is needed to confirm this. This is the causal exploration of the findings of A1~4.
