Causal Exploration: The presence of 'pleural effusion' and 'atelectasis' can be causally related to certain findings. In 'pleural effusion', fluid builds up in the pleural space around the lungs. This can potentially cause tracheal deviation, changes in lung expansion and density, changes in the hilum and lung vessels, and blunting of the costophrenic angle. Meanwhile, 'atelectasis' refers to a collapsed or partially collapsed lung, which can similarly result in changes to lung expansion and density, tracheal and bronchial alterations, and changes in hilar structures. The absence of other abnormalities, such as fractures, free gas, and hiatus hernia, further supports the diagnoses of 'pleural effusion' and 'atelectasis'. These causal relationships help to explain certain findings.
