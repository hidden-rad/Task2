Causal Exploration: The findings of atelectasis and nodule are related to the observations. The atelectasis could be the cause for one lung not being well expanded or larger than the other. Similarly, the presence of a nodule could explain the abnormally increased density area observed. The location information of these findings further support these causal relationships.
