In A4, the words 'atelectasis' and 'nodule' are relevant to A5. 

Atelectasis refers to the partial or complete collapse of a lung, which can result in decreased or absent air movement into the lung. In A5, it is mentioned that both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other. The presence of atelectasis could explain why one lung is not well expanded or larger than the other.

Nodule, on the other hand, refers to a small, abnormal but typically benign growth. In A5, it is mentioned that there is an abnormally increased density area. This could be due to the presence of a nodule.

Therefore, the causal explanation could be:

"Causal Exploration: The findings of atelectasis and nodule in A1 are related to the observations in A5. The atelectasis could be the cause for one lung not being well expanded or larger than the other. Similarly, the presence of a nodule could explain the abnormally increased density area observed. The location information of these findings in A2 and A3 further support these causal relationships."
