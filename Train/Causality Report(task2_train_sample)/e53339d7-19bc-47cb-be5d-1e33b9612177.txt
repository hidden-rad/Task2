Causal Exploration: The presence of a mass and pleural effusion could be the result of certain pathological processes. The mass could cause asymmetry in the lung volumes, leading to one lung appearing larger than the other. On the other hand, the pleural effusion could lead to a blunting of the costophrenic angle, as determined from the location information. The pleural effusion and mass are important findings that could be indicative of underlying lung diseases.
