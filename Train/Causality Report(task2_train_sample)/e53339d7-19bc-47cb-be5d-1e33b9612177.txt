Upon examining A4 and A5, it can be observed that both 'pleural effusion' and 'mass' are present in A4 and these terms are relevant to A5. 

For 'pleural effusion', the relevant part in A5 could be: "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting." This could suggest the presence of fluid in the pleural space, causing a blunting of the costophrenic angle. 

For 'mass', the relevant part in A5 could be: "When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other." This could suggest the presence of a mass causing asymmetry in the lung volumes. 

The causal statement to relate the findings of A1~4 could be: 

"Causal Exploration: The presence of a mass and pleural effusion, as indicated in A1, could be the result of certain pathological processes. The mass could cause asymmetry in the lung volumes, leading to one lung appearing larger than the other as found in A2. On the other hand, the pleural effusion could lead to a blunting of the costophrenic angle, as determined from the location information in A3. The pleural effusion and mass, as included in the list A4, are important findings that could be indicative of underlying lung diseases."
