The word 'pneumonia' in A4 is relevant to the findings in A5, specifically to the statement "When compare the apical,upper,middle and lower zones in turn, there is an abnormally increased density area." This is because an increased density in the lung zones could indicate a pneumonia infection.

Causal Explanation: 
The finding of 'pneumonia' (A1) was located in the 'Parenchyme' and 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)' (A2), specifically between the 8th and 10th position (A3). This could be causing the abnormally increased density area observed in the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones of the lungs. The disease pneumonia typically causes inflammation in the lung tissue, leading to the accumulation of cellular debris and fluids, which can manifest as an increase in density in lung imaging scans. This is part of the causal explanation for the findings from A1 to A4.
