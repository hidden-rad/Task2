Causal Exploration: The presence of a pleural effusion (A1) in the right pleural (A2) was detected in the region from the 2nd to 12th character (A3), and this is consistent with the observed blunting of the costophrenic angle (QA5). This blunting is typically caused by the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, which confirms the diagnosis of a pleural effusion (A4).
