The relevant part in A4 (['pleurisy']) to A5 is 'pleurisy'. Pleurisy is a condition characterized by inflammation of the pleura, which can cause chest pain and other symptoms. In the context of the findings A1~4, the pleurisy was discovered in the Parenchyme, specifically in the LLL(Left Lower Lobe) of the lung.

Causal Exploration: The findings of pleurisy (A1) located in the Parenchyme, LLL(Left Lower Lobe) of the lung (A2) could be associated with the abnormality detected in the specific location (A3). This condition may have been caused by an infection, autoimmune disease, or other lung conditions. As a result, while tracing down each part of the lung, specific symptoms or abnormalities related to pleurisy may have been noticed. These may include sharp chest pain that worsens with breathing or coughing, shortness of breath, cough, and fever. The exact cause of pleurisy should be further investigated to provide a more accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.
