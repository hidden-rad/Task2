Causal Exploration: The discovery of atelectasis in the 'Parenchyme' and 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)' might be the result of an obstruction or pressure in the airways, leading to improper lung inflation. This is corroborated by the noted abnormality in lung expansion. This could be the root cause of the identified atelectasis. Additional examination and medical intervention might be necessary to resolve this issue.
