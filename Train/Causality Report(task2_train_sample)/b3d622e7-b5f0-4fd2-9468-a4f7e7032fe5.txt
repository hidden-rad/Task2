Causal Exploration: The discovery of a 'pleural effusion', pinpointed in the location information ['Pleural', 'Left Pleural', None] and [{'begin': 11, 'end': 12}], might be causally linked to the noted blunting in the costophrenic angles. This is due to the fact that pleural effusion, characterized by the buildup of excess fluid in the pleural space, frequently leads to the blunting of costophrenic angles in radiographic imaging. Hence, this particular observation could be causally explained by the existence of a pleural effusion.
