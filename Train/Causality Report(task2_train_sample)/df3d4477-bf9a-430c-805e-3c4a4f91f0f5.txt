Causal Exploration:
The findings of metastasis and pleural effusion are causally related to the identified symptoms. The spread of cancer cells in metastasis or the buildup of excess fluid in pleural effusion can lead to changes in the lungs and chest cavity, including an increase in density, asymmetry, and other abnormalities. These changes can be identified through medical imaging and examination, helping to diagnose and track the progress of these conditions.
