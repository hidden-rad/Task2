Based on the given information, the word is ['atelectasis']. There is a list of statements about various observations made during a lung examination, none of which directly mention atelectasis. 

However, the statement, ""When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other."", is relevant to 'atelectasis' because atelectasis is a condition where part or all of a lung collapses or fails to inflate properly, which could result in one lung appearing larger than the other.

The finding of 'atelectasis' is indicated in the location of the 'Parenchyme' in the 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)', and further location information is provided.

Therefore, a potential 'Causal Explanation' can be: 

"Atelectasis was found in the parenchyme of the LLL (Left Lower Lobe). This can be related to the observation that the lungs are not similarly expanded in volume. In the case of atelectasis, the affected lung may fail to inflate properly, potentially making it appear smaller than the other lung."
