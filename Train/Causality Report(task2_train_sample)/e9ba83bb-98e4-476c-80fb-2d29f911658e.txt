Firstly, let's take the findings in A1 and A2: 'pleural effusion atelectasis' and the location information. Pleural effusion refers to the accumulation of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs. Atelectasis refers to the collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. The locations mentioned like 'Parenchyme', 'RML(Right Middle Lobe)', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)', 'Left Pleural' correspond to the areas where these conditions are observed.

The statements in A5 describe the normal functioning and structure of these areas. Any deviation from these statements can indicate an abnormality or disease condition such as pleural effusion and atelectasis.

For instance, the statement "When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other." can be related to atelectasis. In atelectasis, there is a collapse of a part or all of a lung, which would result in one lung being less expanded or smaller in volume than the other.

Similarly, the statement "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting." can be related to pleural effusion. In pleural effusion, fluid accumulates in the pleural space, which can lead to blunting of the costophrenic angle.

Hence, we can say:

Causal Explanation: The findings of 'pleural effusion' and 'atelectasis' in the respective locations of the lung are caused by deviations from the normal lung structure and function as described in QA5. The presence of pleural effusion may be indicated by blunting of the costophrenic angle, while the presence of atelectasis may be indicated by one lung being less expanded or smaller in volume than the other. Further investigations are needed for a definitive diagnosis.
