Causal Exploration: The findings of 'pleural effusion' and 'atelectasis' in the respective locations of the lung are caused by deviations from the normal lung structure and function as described in QA5. The presence of pleural effusion may be indicated by blunting of the costophrenic angle, while the presence of atelectasis may be indicated by one lung being less expanded or smaller in volume than the other. Further investigations are needed for a definitive diagnosis.
