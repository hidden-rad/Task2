Causal Exploration: 
The patient is diagnosed with 'chronic obstructive pulmonary disease', which is often associated with abnormal lung and bronchial structure and function. The location of the findings indicates that the disease affects different parts of the lungs, including 'Parenchyme', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', 'RML(Right Middle Lobe)', 'RUL(Right Upper Lobe)', 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)', and 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)', as well as the 'Diaphragm'. The specific details of the findings, including the beginning and end points, further specify the extent and distribution of the disease. 

The causal relationship can be traced through the symptoms described. These include tracheal deviation, changes in bronchial diameter, the presence of foreign bodies, lung expansion, abnormal lung density, and changes in the hilum and lung vessels. These symptoms can be attributed to the damage and inflammation caused by the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, thus explaining the underlying cause of the findings.
