In our exploration of causality, we can examine the conditions identified, namely 'pleural effusion' and 'edema', along with their corresponding explanations. 

For 'pleural effusion', a comprehensive checklist of observations relating to various parts of the respiratory system and other related structures is provided. However, none of these observations suggest the presence of pleural effusion, indicating that the condition may have arisen due to factors not included in this checklist. 

Similarly, for 'edema', the list of observations does not point to a clear cause. 

In the context of 'Causal Exploration', pleural effusion and edema are conditions that often stem from other underlying health issues. Pleural effusion, characterized by the buildup of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs, can be triggered by a variety of conditions such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, or lung cancer. Conversely, edema is swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in the body's tissues, which can be the result of medications, pregnancy or more serious conditions such as heart failure or kidney disease. 

In this instance, the findings do not provide a clear indication of the causes for these conditions. Further medical examination and tests might be necessary to determine the root causes. The location information can assist doctors in targeting these tests and examinations more effectively.
