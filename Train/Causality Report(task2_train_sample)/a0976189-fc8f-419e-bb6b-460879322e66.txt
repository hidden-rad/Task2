From the given information, A1 refers to the finding of [pleural effusion edema], A2 refers to the location information of the finding, and A3 refers to the specific positions of the finding. A4 refers to the words ['pleural effusion', 'edema'] and A5 is a list of the cause of 'pleural effusion' and 'edema'.

To relate the findings of A1~4 in a causal explanation, we need to identify a part in A4 relevant to A5. The relevant parts in A4 are 'pleural effusion' and 'edema'. The causal statements for these terms can be added as follows:

Causal Exploration:

1. Pleural effusion: This condition occurs when excess fluid builds up between the layers of the pleura, the thin membrane that lines the outside of the lungs and the inside of the chest wall. The cause of pleural effusion according to A5 can be due to various conditions like heart failure, pneumonia, or a pulmonary embolism.

2. Edema: This condition refers to swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in the body's tissues. Edema can occur in any part of the body, but it is most commonly observed in the hands, arms, feet, ankles, and legs. According to A5, it can be caused by a number of conditions, including heart, liver, or kidney disease, or from taking certain medications.

These causal statements help in understanding the underlying causes of the findings of pleural effusion and edema and link them to the locations and specific positions identified in A1, A2, and A3.
