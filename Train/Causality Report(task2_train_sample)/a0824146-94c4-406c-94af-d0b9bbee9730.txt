Based on the given information, we can see that 'pleural effusion' (A4) is the finding in medical context. Pleural effusion refers to the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, which can cause symptoms like chest pain and difficulty breathing. 

Looking at the QA5 list, the relevant part to 'pleural effusion' is 'When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting.', as costophrenic angle blunting is a common sign of pleural effusion on a chest radiograph.

Thus, the causal explanation (Causal Exploration) could be:

'Causal Exploration: The finding of pleural effusion (A1), which was located in the right and left pleural areas (A2), is possibly due to the blunting of the costophrenic angle. This was observed when tracing the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles. This condition can cause accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, leading to the observed pleural effusion.'
