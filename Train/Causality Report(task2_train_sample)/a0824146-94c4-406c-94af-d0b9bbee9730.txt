Causal Exploration: The finding of pleural effusion, which was located in the right and left pleural areas, is possibly due to the blunting of the costophrenic angle. This was observed when tracing the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles. This condition can cause accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, leading to the observed pleural effusion.
