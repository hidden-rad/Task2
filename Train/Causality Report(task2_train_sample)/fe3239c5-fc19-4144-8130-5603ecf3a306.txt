Based on the provided information, the relevant parts are 'pleural effusion' and 'atelectasis'. These two terms appear in the provided list and are also mentioned in the question and answer section. 

The causal explanation (CE) could be as follows:

CE1: 'Pleural effusion' is a condition where there is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. This can be caused by a variety of conditions and diseases, such as pneumonia, heart failure, or cancer. The presence of pleural effusion can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath and chest pain, and can be detected through medical imaging techniques such as x-rays or CT scans. 

CE2: 'Atelectasis' is a condition where a part or the whole lung collapses or does not inflate properly. This can be caused by a blockage of the air passages or by pressure on the outside of the lung. Symptoms can include difficulty breathing, cough, and chest pain. Atelectasis can also be detected through medical imaging techniques.

In this case, the location information indicates the presence of these conditions in different parts of the lungs. The specific locations can provide useful information about the possible causes and severity of the conditions. The finding information provides the specific details about the detected conditions. 

'Causal Exploration': The presence of pleural effusion and atelectasis and their specific locations can provide valuable information about the patient's condition. For example, the presence of pleural effusion could indicate an underlying condition such as heart failure or pneumonia, while the presence of atelectasis could indicate a blockage in the air passages. These findings can help guide the diagnosis and treatment of the patient.
