The exploration of causes reveals that the cardiothoracic ratio exceeds 50, which falls outside the normal range. This discrepancy in the heart's size and position suggests cardiomegaly. The cardiomegaly was detected in areas such as the Mediastinum, Middle Mediastinum (Heart), Right Atrium, Left Atrium, Right Ventricle, and Left Ventricle. The location information provided further substantiates this finding. Consequently, the exploration of causes validates the diagnosis of cardiomegaly.
