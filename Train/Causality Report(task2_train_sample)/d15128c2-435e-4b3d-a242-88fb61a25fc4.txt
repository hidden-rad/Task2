Causal Exploration: The findings, namely 'atelectasis', is confirmed by the observation of an abnormally increased density area in the lungs and the lack of proper expansion in one or both lungs. Furthermore, the location of these findings in the 'Parenchyme', 'RUL(Right Upper Lobe)', and an unidentified location, support the diagnosis of atelectasis. This condition results in the collapse or improper expansion of the airways and air sacs in the lung, leading to potential breathing difficulties and decreased oxygen levels in the blood.
