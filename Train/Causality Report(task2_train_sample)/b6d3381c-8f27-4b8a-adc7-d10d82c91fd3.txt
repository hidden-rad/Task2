Causal Exploration:

1. 'Pleural effusion' refers to the accumulation of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs. This condition can cause symptoms such as chest pain, cough, and shortness of breath. The statement mentions "costophrenic angle is blunting", which can be a sign of pleural effusion as it indicates the presence of fluid in the pleural space.

2. 'Atelectasis' is a complete or partial collapse of the entire lung or area of the lung. It occurs when the tiny air sacs (alveoli) within the lung become deflated or possibly filled with alveolar fluid. The statement mentions "one lung is not prominently larger than the other.", indicating that there is no abnormal expansion or collapse of the lungs.

3. 'Mass' in a medical context typically refers to a lump of tissue that has formed a cluster. In the lungs, a mass could be a sign of a number of conditions, including benign (noncancerous) conditions or lung cancer. The statement does not indicate a clear symptom or sign of a mass.

By analyzing the findings, this causal exploration can provide potential explanations for the patient's condition. However, further medical investigations would be necessary to confirm these diagnoses.
