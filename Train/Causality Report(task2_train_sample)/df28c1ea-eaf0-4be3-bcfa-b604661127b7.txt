Given the information provided, it appears that the term 'pneumonia' does not have a direct relevance to the provided statements as none of them explicitly mention or allude to 'pneumonia'. 

However, if we were to infer a causal explanation, it could go as follows:

'Pneumonia' was identified in the 'Parenchyme', 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)' with the location information provided. None of the statements directly mention this condition. However, pneumonia could potentially affect several of the aspects mentioned in the statements. For instance, pneumonia could affect the expansion of the lungs, the density of certain areas in the lungs, and potentially the lung vessels. 

This causal explanation is speculative, given the lack of direct correlation between 'pneumonia' and the provided statements. It is important to consider that each case of pneumonia can present differently and may not necessarily impact the aspects mentioned above. This finding is based on general knowledge of the condition and its potential manifestations.
