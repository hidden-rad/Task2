Causal Exploration: Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs, which may fill with fluid. This could result in changes in the lungs such as an abnormal increase in density area, asymmetry in the zones, or deviation in the trachea. The condition could also affect the bronchial tubes, potentially narrowing them or causing them to be cut off. Therefore, the abnormal findings could be explained by the presence of pneumonia.
