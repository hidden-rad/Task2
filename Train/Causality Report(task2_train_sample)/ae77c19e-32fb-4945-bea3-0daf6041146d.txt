Based on the provided information, the relevant part in A4 (the word 'cardiomegaly') to A5 (the given explanation) can be found in the statement: "When assess cardiac size, cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 and not in the normal range."

Adding a causal explanation to this statement in relation to the findings of A1~4, we get:

Causal Exploration: 
The finding of 'cardiomegaly' (A4) in the location information of 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Ventricle', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Ventricle', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Atrium', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Atrium' (A2) and in the segment with the 'begin' and 'end' coordinates (A3) is causally related to the abnormal cardiothoracic ratio that is over 50 (not in the normal range). This abnormal ratio is a direct result of the enlargement of the heart, which is indicative of 'cardiomegaly'.
