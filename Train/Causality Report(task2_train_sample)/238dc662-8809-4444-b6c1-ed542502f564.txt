Causal Exploration:

Pleural effusion and pneumonia were found in the locations ['Parenchyme', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', None, 'Pleural', 'Right Pleural', None, 'Pleural', 'Left Pleural', None] and [{'begin': 7, 'end': 9}] respectively. These conditions could have been caused by various factors.

For instance, pleural effusion, which is the accumulation of excess fluid in the pleural cavity, can be caused by lung diseases such as pneumonia or conditions that affect the heart, liver, or kidneys. It is mentioned that there is no tracheal deviation and the bronchi and carina are normal. This suggests that the pleural effusion was not caused by a blockage or narrowing of the airways. 

On the other hand, pneumonia, which is an infection of the lungs, can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. It is indicated that there is no abnormally increased density area in the lungs and the hilar vessels are clearly seen. This suggests that the pneumonia was not caused by a build-up of foreign material or a blockage in the lung vessels. 

In conclusion, the findings suggest that the pleural effusion and pneumonia were not caused by physical abnormalities in the lungs or airways, but could have been caused by other factors. Further investigation is needed to identify the exact cause of these conditions.
