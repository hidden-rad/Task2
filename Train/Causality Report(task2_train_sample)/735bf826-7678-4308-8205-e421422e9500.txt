Causal Exploration: The term "pneumonia" signifies an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs, which can fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), leading to symptoms such as cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. This discovery aligns with the location information provided, which indicates abnormal findings in the 'Parenchyme', 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)', and 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)'. These areas of the lungs are commonly affected by pneumonia. Other findings also suggest symptoms commonly associated with pneumonia such as abnormally increased density area in the lungs, and potential issues with the expansion and volume of the lungs.
