Causal Exploration:
The findings of 'atelectasis', 'pleural effusion', and 'pneumonia' can be causally related to the various observations.

1. 'Atelectasis': This condition can cause asymmetry in the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones of the lungs as noted in the observations. The abnormally increased density area could also result from atelectasis as it involves collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. 

2. 'Pleural effusion': This condition refers to the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity. This could potentially cause the noted tracheal deviation, asymmetry in lung zones, and increased density area. It might also lead to the blunting of the costophrenic angle.

3. 'Pneumonia': This infection inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs which can fill with fluid. This could potentially cause one lung to appear prominently larger than the other. The abnormally increased density area and potential blunting of the costophrenic angle could also be a result of this condition.

These explanations show how the abnormalities found are potentially caused by the conditions mentioned. They provide a causal link between the observed symptoms and the identified conditions, thus contributing to a better understanding of the patient's health status.
