Causal Exploration: The observed blunting of the costophrenic angle could potentially be a result of a pleural effusion, an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. This condition can be triggered by a variety of factors, including heart failure, pneumonia, or a pulmonary embolism. Conversely, the noted absence of subcutaneous emphysema might indicate the existence of edema, another condition that could be caused by issues such as kidney disease or heart failure. Both of these conditions have the potential to result in an abnormal chest X-ray and necessitate further examination to reach a definitive diagnosis.
