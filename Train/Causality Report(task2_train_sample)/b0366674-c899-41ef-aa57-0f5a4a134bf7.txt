Causal Exploration: 
The discovery of 'pneumothorax' situated within the 'Parenchyme' and 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)', along with the specific location information, can be causally linked to the statement. In the instance of a pneumothorax, air escapes from the lung and fills the space outside of the lung, between the lung and chest wall. This can lead to the lung collapsing, resulting in one lung appearing significantly larger than the other, as stated. This irregularity would be identified during the review of the chest imaging, which aligns with the findings. Therefore, the pneumothorax is the cause of the observed asymmetry in lung volume.
