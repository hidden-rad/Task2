Causal Exploration:

The findings indicate the presence of 'cardiomegaly', 'pleural effusion', and 'pneumonia' in the patient. These words correspond to the diseases identified.

The location information of the findings indicates that the 'cardiomegaly' is found in the 'Parenchyme' and 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', the 'pleural effusion' is found in the 'Pleural' and 'Left Pleural', and the 'pneumonia' is found in the 'Pleural' and 'Right Pleural'. 

The information provides the specific locations ['begin': 4, 'end': 4], ['begin': 7, 'end': 11] of the diseases in the patient's body which aligns with the given locations.

Causal Exploration:
'Cardiomegaly' is typically caused by high blood pressure or coronary artery disease. These conditions cause the heart to work harder, leading to its enlargement. 

'Pleural effusion' can be caused by a variety of conditions such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, or a pulmonary embolism. It occurs when excess fluid builds up in the pleural space, the area between the lungs and the chest wall.

'Pneumonia' is usually caused by bacterial or viral infections in the lungs. The body sends white blood cells to attack the infection, which leads to inflammation and fluid build-up in the alveoli.

The findings, therefore, could be explained by the presence of these conditions. The symptoms and the locations of these conditions are consistent with the known medical understanding of these diseases. 

Therefore, the Causal Exploration for the findings could be that the presence of high blood pressure or coronary artery disease has led to 'cardiomegaly', bacterial or viral infections have caused 'pneumonia', and these or other conditions such as a pulmonary embolism have resulted in 'pleural effusion'.
