Causal Exploration: The detected atelectasis in the lower left section of the lung is probably responsible for the observed asymmetry in lung volume. This condition has resulted in one lung being smaller than its counterpart, which could potentially lead to respiratory complications. Additional examination is required to validate this theory and establish the suitable treatment.
