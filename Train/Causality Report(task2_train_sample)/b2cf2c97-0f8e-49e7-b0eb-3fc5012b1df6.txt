To explain causally, one needs to understand the diseases mentioned in A4. Pleural effusion refers to the buildup of fluid between the layers of tissue that line the lungs and chest cavity, while atelectasis is a complete or partial collapse of the entire lung or area of the lung.

In QA5, we find a number of statements related to these conditions. For instance, the statement "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting." can be associated with pleural effusion. The blunting of the costophrenic angle is a common sign of pleural effusion, indicating the presence of fluid in the pleural space.

Similarly, the statement "When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other." can be related to atelectasis. One lung being not prominently larger than the other might indicate an area of lung collapse.

Therefore, the causal explanation for A1~4 can be constructed as follows:

Causal Exploration: The presence of pleural effusion and atelectasis, as indicated in A1, can be related to the abnormalities observed in A2 and A3. The blunting of costophrenic angles suggests the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, a characteristic sign of pleural effusion. Moreover, the lack of prominent enlargement of one lung suggests the possibility of atelectasis, a condition where a part or the whole lung collapses. These findings provide a causal explanation for the observations made in A4. Further diagnostic tests and assessments are needed to confirm these conditions and plan appropriate treatment strategies.
