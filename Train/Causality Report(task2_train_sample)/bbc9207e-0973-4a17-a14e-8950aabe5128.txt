Causal Exploration: The discovery of Pleural Effusion in the locations 'Pleural', 'Right Pleural', and 'Left Pleural' with the given location details can be linked to the abnormalities identified in the assessment. Specifically, 'When tracing the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, there is a blunting of the costophrenic angle.' This blunting could lead to an accumulation of fluid, resulting in a pleural effusion. The patient's clinical history and other diagnostic tests should be further evaluated to confirm this causal relationship and determine the appropriate treatment plan.
