Causal Exploration: The occurrence of 'cardiomegaly' (A4) is observed in the given medical data. This is identified (A1) in the regions of 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Ventricle', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Atrium', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Atrium', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Ventricle' (A2) with location coordinates (A3). This condition is evidenced by the fact that when assessing the cardiac size, the cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 and not in the normal range (A5). The abnormal enlargement of the heart, as indicated by the increased cardiothoracic ratio, is a clear indication of cardiomegaly."
