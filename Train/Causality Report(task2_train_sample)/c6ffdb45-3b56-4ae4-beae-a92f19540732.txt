First, we need to identify the relevant parts in the first set. This set consists of ['atelectasis', 'pleural effusion']. In the second set, there are two findings which are 'atelectasis' and 'pleural effusion'. Therefore, both parts in the first set are relevant to the second set.

Next, we add the causal statements for both 'atelectasis' and 'pleural effusion'. 

For 'atelectasis', we can add a causal statement like this: 'Atelectasis, a condition where the airways or alveoli of the lungs collapse or close, can be caused by several factors including obstruction of the bronchus or bronchioles or by pressure on the outside of the lung. This can result in reduced or absent gas exchange in the lung, leading to symptoms like difficulty breathing and cough. In our findings, the location information indicates the presence of atelectasis in the 'Parenchyme' and 'RML(Right Middle Lobe)', which could potentially explain the patient's clinical presentation.'

For 'pleural effusion', we can add a causal statement like this: 'Pleural effusion, a condition where excess fluid builds up in the pleural cavity, can be caused by several conditions including congestive heart failure, pneumonia, and malignancies. The excess fluid can put pressure on the lung, preventing it from fully expanding when inhaling, leading to symptoms like chest pain, persistent cough, and shortness of breath. In our findings, the location information indicates the presence of pleural effusion in the 'Pleural' and 'Left Pleural', which could potentially explain the patient's clinical presentation.'

Finally, by adding 'Causal Exploration', we can conclude that 'The findings of atelectasis and pleural effusion in our patient can be explained by the potential obstructions in the bronchus or pressure on the lung, and the accumulation of excess fluid in the pleural cavity, respectively. Further diagnostic tests could confirm these causal explanations and help guide appropriate treatment strategies.'
