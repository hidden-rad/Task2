Causal Exploration: Lymphadenopathy, which is the condition of having swollen or enlarged lymph nodes, was discovered in the locations 'Etc', 'Right Hilum', 'Etc', 'Left Hilum'. This condition can be visualized in the given range from the 6th to the 8th position. This finding could be related to the abnormal shape of the hilum noted in the chest x-ray report. Abnormalities in the hilum, such as not forming a good inverted C-shape, can be caused by lymphadenopathy, as the enlarged lymph nodes can distort the normal structures and architecture of the hilum. This could be the potential cause of the observed abnormality in the chest x-ray.
