Causal Exploration: The findings may be caused by the presence of pleural effusion and atelectasis in the patient. The pleural effusion may be causing the blunting of the costophrenic angle and the lower position of the right diaphragm, while the atelectasis may be causing the unequal size of the lungs and the increased density in certain areas. These conditions should be further investigated to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment.
