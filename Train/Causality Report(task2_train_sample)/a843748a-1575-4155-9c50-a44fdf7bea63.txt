From the list A4, both terms 'pleural effusion' and 'atelectasis' are relevant to QA5. 

'Pleural effusion' is a medical condition where there is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. This can be caused by various medical conditions such as pneumonia, heart failure, and lung cancer. In the context of the statements in QA5, the presence of pleural effusion may explain abnormalities such as "costophrenic angle is blunting" and "right diaphragm is not higher than left". These abnormalities can be caused by the excess fluid pushing against the lung and diaphragm, distorting the normal anatomy.

'Atelectasis' is a condition where part of the lung collapses or does not inflate properly. It can be caused by a blockage of the air passages or by pressure on the outside of the lung. In the context of the statements in QA5, the presence of atelectasis may explain findings such as "one lung is not prominently larger than the other" and "there is no abnormally increased density area". A collapsed lung may appear smaller and denser on imaging studies.

Causal Explanation: The findings in A1, A2, and A3 may be caused by the presence of pleural effusion and atelectasis in the patient. The pleural effusion may be causing the blunting of the costophrenic angle and the lower position of the right diaphragm, while the atelectasis may be causing the unequal size of the lungs and the increased density in certain areas. These conditions should be further investigated to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment.
