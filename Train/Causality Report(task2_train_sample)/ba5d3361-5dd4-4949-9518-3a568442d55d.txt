Causal Exploration: The presence of conditions such as 'cardiomegaly' and 'pleural effusion' can be attributed to various factors. The cardiothoracic ratio being over 50 and not within the normal range suggests an enlarged heart, or 'cardiomegaly'. This could be a result of conditions like high blood pressure or coronary artery disease. Additionally, the costophrenic angle not being blunted could point towards 'pleural effusion'. This might occur due to conditions such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, or lung cancer. Therefore, the findings related to these conditions are causally connected, as they provide potential explanations for the observed abnormalities.
