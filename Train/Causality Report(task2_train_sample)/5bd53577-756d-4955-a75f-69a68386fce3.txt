'Pleural effusion' is a term for the unusual build-up of fluid in the pleural space, which can be triggered by a variety of conditions including pneumonia, tuberculosis, and lung cancer. In this particular case, 'pleural effusion' could have been induced by any of these conditions. The location details suggest that the effusion is located in the 'Parenchyme', 'Right Lower Lobe', 'Left Lower Lobe', 'Right Pleural', and 'Left Pleural'. 

'Cardiomegaly' is a medical term for an enlarged heart, often a symptom of conditions such as heart failure or coronary artery disease. In this particular case, 'cardiomegaly' could have been caused by these underlying conditions. The location details suggest that the enlargement is located in the 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Ventricle', 'Right Ventricle', 'Left Atrium', and 'Right Atrium'.

'Edema' is a condition marked by an excess of watery fluid accumulating in the body's cavities or tissues. It is often caused by heart failure, liver cirrhosis, or kidney disease. In this particular case, 'edema' could have been caused by these underlying conditions. The location details do not provide specific locations for the edema, suggesting that it could be widespread.

In conclusion, the findings suggest the presence of 'pleural effusion', 'cardiomegaly', and 'edema', which could be caused by various underlying conditions. Additional diagnostic tests are needed to determine the exact cause of these conditions.
