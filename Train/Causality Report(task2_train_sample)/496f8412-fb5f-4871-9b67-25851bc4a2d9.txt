The findings A1, A2 and A3 represent the medical conditions 'pneumonia' and 'pleural effusion', along with their corresponding location information. In A5, we have detailed descriptions of these conditions. 

From A5, we can see that 'pneumonia' and 'pleural effusion' are both associated with abnormal imaging findings. For 'pneumonia', the statement "When compare the apical,upper,middle and lower zones in turn, there is an abnormally increased density area." is relevant. This could be due to the inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lung tissues caused by the infection, which is a characteristic of pneumonia.

For 'pleural effusion', the statement "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is not blunted." is relevant. Pleural effusion often results in a blunted costophrenic angle on imaging due to the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space.

Causal Explanation: The findings of pneumonia and pleural effusion in the patient can be causally linked to the abnormalities observed in the imaging. The increased density in the lung zones is likely due to the inflammation and fluid accumulation caused by pneumonia. Similarly, the non-blunted costophrenic angle is likely due to the presence of excess fluid in the pleural space, a characteristic of pleural effusion. These causal links provide a more comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition.
