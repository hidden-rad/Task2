Causal Exploration: The findings of pneumonia and pleural effusion in the patient can be causally linked to the abnormalities observed in the imaging. The increased density in the lung zones is likely due to the inflammation and fluid accumulation caused by pneumonia. Similarly, the non-blunted costophrenic angle is likely due to the presence of excess fluid in the pleural space, a characteristic of pleural effusion. These causal links provide a more comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition.
