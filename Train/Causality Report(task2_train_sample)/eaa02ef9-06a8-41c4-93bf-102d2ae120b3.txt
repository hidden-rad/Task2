Causal Exploration: The discovery of 'pleural effusion' in the specified location information can be causally explained by the observation that 'When tracing the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, the costophrenic angle appears blunted.' This blunting of the costophrenic angles is often observed in cases of pleural effusion, where excess fluid accumulates in the pleural space around the lungs, causing the normally sharp costophrenic angles to appear blunted or obscured. This statement provides a causal connection between the observed 'pleural effusion' and the identified changes in the costophrenic angles.
