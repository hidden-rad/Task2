Causal Exploration could be defined as follows:

The detection of an 'atelectasis' condition was noted in the 'Parenchyme' and 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)' based on the location information from 6 to 8. This condition might have led to the irregularity of one lung not being significantly larger than the other, as described in the report stating, "When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not significantly larger than the other." This could suggest that the lung is not fully expanded, a typical symptom of 'atelectasis'.
