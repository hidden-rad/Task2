Causal Exploration: 
The finding of cardiomegaly was located in the Mediastinum, specifically in the Middle Mediastinum(Heart) and Left Ventricle, as denoted by the location information [{'begin': 10, 'end': 11}]. This condition is depicted in the statement "When assess cardiac size, cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 and not in the normal range". Causal exploration reveals that cardiomegaly refers to an enlarged heart, which can be ascertained by an increased cardiothoracic ratio. This enlargement can be caused by high blood pressure or coronary artery disease, and it can result in shortness of breath, fainting, and other complications. In this context, the increased cardiothoracic ratio is a direct indicator of cardiomegaly.
