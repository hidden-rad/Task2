Firstly, we need to identify the part in A4 (['atelectasis']) that is relevant to QA5. Atelectasis is a condition where the alveoli in the lung are deflated, it is not a natural occurrence but rather due to a blockage or pressure from outside the lung. 

From the descriptions in QA5, the relevant part seems to be "When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other.", as this could indicate that one lung is not properly expanding, which is a symptom of atelectasis.

Now, let's construct the causal explanation by relating the findings A1~4:

"Causal Exploration: The detection of pleural effusion (A1) can cause pressure on the lung leading to a contraction in its size, this could result in atelectasis (A4). The condition was identified in the right middle lobe of the lung parenchyme (A2), as indicated by the location information (A3). This is consistent with the observation in the chest radiograph where one lung appears not as prominently large as the other (part of QA5). Therefore, the pleural effusion could be the underlying cause of the atelectasis observed."
