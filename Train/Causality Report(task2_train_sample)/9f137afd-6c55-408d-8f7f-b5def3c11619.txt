Causal Exploration: The detection of pleural effusion (A1) can cause pressure on the lung leading to a contraction in its size, this could result in atelectasis (A4). The condition was identified in the right middle lobe of the lung parenchyme (A2), as indicated by the location information (A3). This is consistent with the observation in the chest radiograph where one lung appears not as prominently large as the other (part of QA5). Therefore, the pleural effusion could be the underlying cause of the atelectasis observed."
