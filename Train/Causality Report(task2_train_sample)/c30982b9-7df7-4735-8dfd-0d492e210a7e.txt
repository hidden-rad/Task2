Causal Exploration: The detection of the costophrenic angles' dulling, found while outlining the lateral edges of the lung, signifies the existence of pleural effusion. This could be attributed to a variety of reasons such as heart failure, pneumonia, or malignancies. The discovery of 'pleural effusion' was situated in either the 'Pleural' region, the 'Left Pleural' region, or it was not explicitly stated. The precise location details of the discovery were found between the third and eleventh words in the examined document. Hence, the observation of the 'pleural effusion' and the dulling of the costophrenic angles are findings that are causally connected.
