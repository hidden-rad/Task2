Causal Exploration: 
The discovery of 'cardiomegaly' in the location details of various parts of the 'Mediastinum', including the 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Ventricle', 'Right Ventricle', 'Left Atrium', and 'Right Atrium', as well as in the segment with the 'begin' and 'end' coordinates, is causally linked to an abnormal cardiothoracic ratio exceeding 50 (outside the normal range). This abnormal ratio is a direct consequence of heart enlargement, which signifies 'cardiomegaly'.
