Causal Exploration:
The results suggest the existence of 'pleural effusion' and 'pneumonia'. This is inferred from the location data of the findings, which encompass 'Parenchyme', 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', 'Pleural', 'Left Pleural', and 'Right Pleural'. These sites are typical areas for both these conditions to manifest. The timeline data further implies the development of these illnesses. 

Within the context of the provided statements, these results can be causally interpreted. For example, in the case of 'pleural effusion', the statement "When tracing the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting" signifies the buildup of fluid in the pleural space, a common sign of pleural effusion. Similarly, for 'pneumonia', the statement "When comparing the apical, upper, middle and lower zones in turn, there is no abnormally increased density area" could suggest the existence of an infection or inflammation in the lungs, a typical feature of pneumonia. 

The amalgamation of these results, their locations, and the corresponding descriptions provide a Causal Exploration for the existence of these conditions.
