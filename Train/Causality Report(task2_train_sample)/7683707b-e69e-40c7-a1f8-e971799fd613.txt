Causal Explanation: 

The discovery of 'pleural effusion' in the location ['Pleural', 'Left Pleural', None] with a specified position can be causally connected to the observation where the costophrenic angle is blunting. This is due to the fact that pleural effusion, which refers to the buildup of excess fluid in the pleural space, can lead to the costophrenic angles (the angles between the ribs and the diaphragm) appearing blunt or less sharp in imaging. This is a common symptom of pleural effusion and can assist in diagnosing and treating the condition. Hence, the existence of pleural effusion could potentially be the cause for the observed blunting of the costophrenic angle.
