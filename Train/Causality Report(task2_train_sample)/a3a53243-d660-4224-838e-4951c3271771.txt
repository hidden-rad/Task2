Causal Explanation: The identified presence of pleural effusion is located in the specified areas ('Pleural', 'Right Pleural', None, 'Pleural', 'Left Pleural', None). This was determined using the provided location information, which indicates the beginning and end of the finding. In this context, the statement 'When tracing the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting.' could be indicative of the presence of pleural effusion, as blunting of the costophrenic angle can be a sign of this condition. Therefore, the findings suggest that the patient may have pleural effusion. 

Please note that this is a hypothetical interpretation and further medical investigations are required for a confirmed diagnosis.
