Causal Exploration: The finding of 'pleural effusion' in the specified location information can be causally explained by the observation that 'When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting.' This blunting of the costophrenic angles is often seen in cases of pleural effusion, where excess fluid builds up in the pleural space around the lungs, causing the normally sharp costophrenic angles to appear blunted or obscured. This statement provides a causal link between the observed 'pleural effusion' and the identified changes in the costophrenic angles.
