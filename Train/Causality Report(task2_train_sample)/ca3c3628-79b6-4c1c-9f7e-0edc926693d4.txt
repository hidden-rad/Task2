The atelectasis was identified in the 'Parenchyme', specifically in the 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)' region. The location details suggest that it was discovered within the 10th to 11th segment of the parenchyma. 

This could potentially be linked to the observed unusual increase in density area in the lower zones of the lung. This abnormal density could indicate atelectasis, as it is frequently connected with a collapse of the lung tissue, resulting in a loss of volume and increased density. 

Therefore, the atelectasis found in the RLL (Right Lower Lobe) could be causally related to the abnormal increased density area discovered in the lower zones of the lung. This provides a Causal Exploration for the findings.
