"Causal Exploration: The observed dulling of the costophrenic angle in the examination suggests the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, which results in a pleural effusion. This is mainly seen in the right side of the pleural area. Moreover, the fact that there isn't a significant difference in the volume of both lungs implies a potential collapse or blockage in a section of the lung, a condition known as atelectasis. This is particularly evident in certain sections of the right and left lungs. Thus, the examination findings of pleural effusion and atelectasis are directly linked to the detected irregularities in the lungs and pleural area."
