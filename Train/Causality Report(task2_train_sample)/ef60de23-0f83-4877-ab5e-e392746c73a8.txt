Causal Exploration: The discovery of a pleural effusion in our list of terms is not linked to a blunting of the costophrenic angles according to our observation. This implies that the pleural effusion might be situated in regions other than the costophrenic angles, potentially in the 'Right Pleural' or 'Left Pleural' areas as suggested by the location information. However, we currently do not have additional location information to verify this.
