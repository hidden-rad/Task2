Causal Exploration: The discovery of atelectasis in the parenchyme of the left upper and lower lobes might be the reason behind the noticeable size difference and heightened density in certain lung zones. This situation could hinder the lung's capacity to inflate and deflate correctly, which could disrupt the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, possibly leading to a state of hypoxia. Identifying and addressing the cause of the atelectasis is crucial to prevent additional lung damage and related complications.
