"Causal Exploration: The 'Pleural effusion' identified was located in the specified regions ['Pleural', 'Left Pleural', None, 'Pleural', 'Right Pleural', None] as per the provided location information [{'begin': 8, 'end': 11}]. This could be related to observations such as 'costophrenic angle is blunting', which is a common sign of pleural effusion. Pleural effusion is a condition where excess fluid builds up in the pleural space, the area between the lungs and the chest wall. This fluid can lead to difficulty breathing and a blunting of the costophrenic angle."
