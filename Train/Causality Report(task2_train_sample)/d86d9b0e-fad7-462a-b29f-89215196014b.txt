Causal Exploration: The presence of 'mass pleural effusion' can be explained by its location in the 'Parenchyme' and 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)', as well as in the 'Parenchyme' and 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)'. These locations are specified by the given coordinates. This condition can cause symptoms such as abnormal increased density in the lung areas and costophrenic angle blunting, which are relevant to 'pneumonia' and 'pleural effusion'. These changes are reflected in the findings. Therefore, the symptoms can be attributed to the effects of pneumonia and pleural effusion due to the mass pleural effusion located in specific parts of the lungs.
