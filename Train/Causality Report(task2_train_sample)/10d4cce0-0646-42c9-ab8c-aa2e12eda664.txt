The exploration of potential causes for these findings could be as follows:

Enlarged Heart: The heart appears to be enlarged, as suggested by a cardiothoracic ratio exceeding 50, which is outside the normal range. This enlargement could be due to a variety of factors such as elevated blood pressure, issues with the heart valve, or heart muscle diseases. 

Fluid in the Pleura: The detection of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs suggests the presence of fluid in the pleura. This condition could be caused by illnesses like pneumonia, tuberculosis, or lung cancer. It can also be a result of heart failure, which might provide an explanation for the simultaneous finding of an enlarged heart.

Both these conditions necessitate further medical examination for a precise diagnosis and appropriate treatment. It's crucial to mention that both conditions have the potential to impact the functioning of the heart and lungs and could lead to severe complications if not addressed promptly. 

Therefore, the exploration of potential causes suggests that the findings of an enlarged heart and fluid in the pleura indicate possible heart and lung diseases, which are supported by the other findings.
