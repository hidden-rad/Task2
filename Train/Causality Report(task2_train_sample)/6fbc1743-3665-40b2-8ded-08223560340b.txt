Based on the provided information, the relevant part in A4 (['atelectasis']) to A5 can be the decreased lung expansion as atelectasis refers to a partial or complete collapse of a lung or a section (lobe) of a lung. 

A1 is the finding of 'atelectasis', A2 provides the location information ['Parenchyme', 'RML(Right Middle Lobe)', None], and A3 provides the specific coordinates of the finding [{'begin': 9, 'end': 11}].

Causal Explanation:
The presence of atelectasis (A1) can be observed in the right middle lobe (RML) of the lung parenchyma (A2). The specific location of the atelectasis can be pinpointed to the coordinates provided (A3). This condition is caused by a blockage of the air passages (bronchus or bronchioles) or by pressure on the outside of the lung. Atelectasis can make it harder for the body to get oxygen into the bloodstream. This condition can lead to a lack of proper lung expansion, which is a clear sign of atelectasis as mentioned in A5. 

As for QA5, the part of the statement, "When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other." could be relevant to A4, as the atelectasis could cause one lung to not expand properly and appear smaller in volume compared to the other.
