Causal Exploration:
The presence of atelectasis can be observed in the right middle lobe (RML) of the lung parenchyma. The specific location of the atelectasis can be pinpointed to the coordinates provided. This condition is caused by a blockage of the air passages (bronchus or bronchioles) or by pressure on the outside of the lung. Atelectasis can make it harder for the body to get oxygen into the bloodstream. This condition can lead to a lack of proper lung expansion, which is a clear sign of atelectasis. 

As for the part of the statement, "When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other." could be relevant, as the atelectasis could cause one lung to not expand properly and appear smaller in volume compared to the other.
