Based on the provided data, it seems like 'atelectasis' (A4) is related to the statement `"When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other."` in A5. Atelectasis is a condition where the lungs are not fully expanded, which could lead to one lung being prominently larger than the other.

So, the causal explanation (Causal Exploration) could be:

"An occurrence of 'atelectasis' was identified (A1) in the 'Parenchyme' and 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)' (A2) based on the location information from 6 to 8 (A3). This condition may have caused the abnormality of one lung not being prominently larger than the other as mentioned in the statement `"When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other."` in the report (A5). This could be an indication of the lung not being fully expanded, which is a characteristic symptom of 'atelectasis'.".
