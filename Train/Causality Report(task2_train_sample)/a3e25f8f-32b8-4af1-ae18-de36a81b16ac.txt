First, we identify the relevant parts in A4 (['pleural effusion', 'pneumonia']) to A5. The elements in A5 are defined by the conditions 'pleural effusion' and 'pneumonia'. 

Next, we derive the causal statements. 

For 'pleural effusion', the causal statement may be: "The costophrenic angle blunting observed in A2 is likely due to the presence of pleural effusion. This is supported by the findings in A1 and corroborated by the location information in A3. The pleural effusion could be the result of various conditions, including pneumonia, tuberculosis, or cancer."

For 'pneumonia', the causal statement may be: "The abnormally increased density area observed in A2 could be a sign of pneumonia. Furthermore, the findings in A1 and the location information in A3 support this diagnosis. Pneumonia often results in lung inflammation, which can lead to pleural effusion."

Finally, we can combine these causal statements into a 'Causal Exploration':

"Causal Exploration: The abnormalities observed in A1 and A2, including costophrenic angle blunting and increased density area, may be explained by the conditions 'pleural effusion' and 'pneumonia' identified in A4. The location information provided in A3 further supports these findings. It is important to note that while pleural effusion could be caused by pneumonia, it can also be a result of other conditions such as tuberculosis or cancer. Similarly, the presence of pneumonia can lead to lung inflammation and subsequently pleural effusion."
