"Causal Exploration: The discovery of conditions such as 'pleural effusion' and 'mass' are identified within the lung based on the provided location details. These conditions may lead to various symptoms or irregularities. For example, a 'mass' in the lung might result in alterations in lung volume, or abnormal density areas. Similarly, 'pleural effusion' could result in the blunting of the costophrenic angle, or changes in the tracheal diameter. Therefore, the existence of 'pleural effusion' and 'mass' could potentially be the cause of these observations."
