In the list, we have the medical conditions 'pleural effusion', 'pneumonia', and 'cardiomegaly'. It is evident that each of these conditions is related to various aspects of the chest x-ray scan.

For 'pleural effusion', it is mentioned that "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting". This could be a causal explanation for the occurrence of pleural effusion, as the blunting of costophrenic angles is a typical sign of this condition. 

For 'pneumonia', a potential causal explanation could be related to the statement "When compare the apical, upper, middle and lower zones in turn, there is no abnormally increased density area.". This could suggest that an abnormally increased density area, which is not present in this case, is often a sign of pneumonia.

For 'cardiomegaly', the statement "When assess cardiac size, cardiothoracic ratio does not exceed 50 and is in the normal range." could serve as a causal explanation. In cases of cardiomegaly, the cardiothoracic ratio often exceeds 50, indicating an enlarged heart.

Therefore, the 'Causal Exploration' would be: 

The blunting of costophrenic angles in the chest x-ray might be causing the pleural effusion. The absence of an abnormally increased density area could suggest a lack of infection or inflammation in the lungs, thereby ruling out pneumonia. The normal cardiothoracic ratio might suggest that there is no enlargement of the heart, and hence, no cardiomegaly. These findings align with the location information provided.
