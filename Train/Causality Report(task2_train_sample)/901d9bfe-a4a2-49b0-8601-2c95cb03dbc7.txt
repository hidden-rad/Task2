This condition may be responsible for the blunting of the costophrenic angle observed in the patient's lung. Pleural effusion refers to the buildup of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs. It can lead to a blunted costophrenic angle, which is a classic sign of pleural effusion observed in radiological examinations.
