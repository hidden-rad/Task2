Causal Exploration:

1. Cardiomegaly: The condition of cardiomegaly is found in the patient. The location of this finding is in the 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Atrium', 'Mediastinum', 'Left Atrium', 'Mediastinum', 'Right Ventricle', 'Mediastinum', 'Left Ventricle'. This is further supported by the observations that indicate an abnormality in the heart's size, with the cardiothoracic ratio being over 50, which is not the normal range. This condition could be caused by several factors, including high blood pressure or coronary artery disease, which make the heart work harder and, as a result, become enlarged.

2. Pleural Effusion: The presence of pleural effusion is also indicated. The location of this finding is None, indicating that the effusion is not localized to a specific area but spread throughout the pleural space. Further observations support this finding with the note that there is no blunting of the costophrenic angle, which is typically seen in cases of pleural effusion. This could be due to various causes such as infection, malignancy, or heart failure. In the case of heart failure, which could be related to the cardiomegaly finding, the heart does not pump blood effectively, leading to an accumulation of fluid in the lungs and pleural space.

In conclusion, the findings which include the words 'cardiomegaly' and 'pleural effusion' and their specific locations, are causally explained by the observations. This causal exploration provides a better understanding of the potential underlying causes of the patient's condition.
