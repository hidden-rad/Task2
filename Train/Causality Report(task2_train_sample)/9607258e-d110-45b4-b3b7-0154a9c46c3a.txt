The primary discovery was the identification of pneumonia in the right and left lower sections of the lungs. The exact locations within these sections were pinpointed to be at two specific positions. The presence of pneumonia is probably the reason for the unusually heightened density seen in the top, upper, middle, and lower zones of the lungs. This implies that the infection has triggered inflammation and consolidation within these areas, leading to a rise in their density.
