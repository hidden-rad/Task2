Causal Exploration: The presence of pleural effusion may have occurred due to the blunting of the costophrenic angle. The absence of tracheal deviation, narrowed or widened bronchial, inhaled foreign body, abnormal lung expansion, or abnormal density area suggest the pleural effusion is not caused by these conditions. 

For 'pneumonia', the Causal Exploration could be:

Causal Exploration: The presence of pneumonia could be linked to the various observations, such as no tracheal deviation, maintained bronchial diameter, absence of inhaled foreign bodies, and normal lung expansion. The absence of abnormal density area in the lungs may suggest that the pneumonia is not severe.

In conclusion, the findings suggest the presence of pleural effusion and pneumonia, which can be causally explained by the absence of certain abnormalities observed in the chest. This causal exploration provides a better understanding of the conditions and their possible causes.
