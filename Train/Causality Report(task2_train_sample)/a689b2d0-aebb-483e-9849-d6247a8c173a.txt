From the information given, we can identify that both 'pleural effusion' and 'pneumonia' are part of A4 and are relevant to A5. The causal statements associated with these terms are the descriptions provided in A5.

For 'pleural effusion', the causal explanation could be: 

Causal Exploration: The presence of pleural effusion may have occurred due to the blunting of the costophrenic angle as described in the A5 statement. The absence of tracheal deviation, narrowed or widened bronchial, inhaled foreign body, abnormal lung expansion, or abnormal density area suggest the pleural effusion is not caused by these conditions. 

For 'pneumonia', the causal explanation could be:

Causal Exploration: The presence of pneumonia could be linked to the various observations mentioned in the A5 statement, such as no tracheal deviation, maintained bronchial diameter, absence of inhaled foreign bodies, and normal lung expansion. The absence of abnormal density area in the lungs may suggest that the pneumonia is not severe.

In conclusion, the findings A1~4 suggest the presence of pleural effusion and pneumonia, which can be causally explained by the absence of certain abnormalities observed in the chest, as described in A5. This causal exploration provides a better understanding of the conditions and their possible causes.
