Causal Exploration: The findings of A1~4 indicate the presence of pneumonia and pleural effusion. Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs, which may fill with fluid or pus, causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. This could be the cause of the abnormally increased density area in the lower zones of the lungs, as indicated in A2 and A3.

Pleural effusion, on the other hand, is the build-up of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs. It's a symptom of many medical conditions and can cause shortness of breath, chest pain, or cough. This could be the cause of the blunted costophrenic angle and the prominence of one lung over the other, as indicated in A2 and A3.

Therefore, the observations in A2 and A3 could be seen as symptoms of the conditions mentioned in A4, which explains the findings in A1.
