In A4, the term 'edema' refers to the swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in the body's tissues. It is often associated with lung diseases or damage. 

Given the findings of A1~4, we can see that edema was identified in various locations in the lung parenchyma, including the left and right upper and lower lobes as well as the right middle lobe. 

In A5, the detailed examination of the lungs and related structures doesn't reveal any significant abnormalities such as tracheal deviation, narrowed bronchi, inhaled foreign bodies, abnormal lung volume, extra lines in the periphery that are not blood vessels, or a blunted costophrenic angle, among others. 

However, the presence of edema as revealed in A1~3 is significant. It might be indicative of an underlying condition causing fluid build-up in the lungs, which could potentially be responsible for the increased density area observed in the lungs. 

Causal Explanation: The presence of edema in multiple areas of the lung parenchyma could indicate a systemic issue causing fluid accumulation. This could potentially be the reason for the abnormally increased density area observed in the lungs. Further diagnostic tests and medical history would be necessary to pinpoint the exact cause and to rule out conditions such as heart disease, lung disease, or damage to the lymphatic system.
