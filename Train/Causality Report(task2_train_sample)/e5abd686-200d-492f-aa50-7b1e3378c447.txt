The part in A4 relevant to A5 can be identified as 'cardiomegaly' and 'pleural effusion'. These medical terms refer to the enlargement of the heart and the build-up of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs, respectively. 

In the context of A1 - A4, the findings indicate the presence of these conditions, with their locations specified in A3. The causal statement could be constructed as follows:

"Causal Exploration: The cardiomegaly identified in the Middle Mediastinum(Heart), Right Atrium, Right Ventricle, and Left Ventricle might be a result of a long-standing heart condition that has caused the heart to work harder and consequently increase in size. The pleural effusion detected in the Right Pleural and Left Pleural might be due to the heart's inability to effectively pump blood, leading to fluid build-up in the pleural space. These findings provide a causal explanation for the symptoms experienced by the patient and inform the course of treatment." 

This statement correlates the findings in A1 - A4, providing a causal explanation for the identified conditions.
