Causal Exploration: The discoveries of an enlarged heart and fluid accumulation in the pleural space are corroborated by the provided location information. This heart enlargement and unusual fluid buildup may be the root cause of the abnormal observations previously mentioned. A cardiothoracic ratio exceeding 50 suggests an enlarged heart, potentially due to conditions such as heart disease or hypertension. The non-blunted costophrenic angle and the lack of subcutaneous emphysema could be attributed to the pleural effusion, which is often a result of conditions like pneumonia, liver disease, or kidney disease. Therefore, these findings can causally explain the observed abnormalities.
