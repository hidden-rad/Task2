Causal Exploration:

Pneumonia is related to the findings as it is a condition that causes inflammation in the lungs due to a bacterial or viral infection. This leads to an increased density in the lungs, as seen in the statement, "When compare the apical, upper, middle and lower zones in turn, there is an abnormally increased density area." This increased density could be due to the buildup of fluid and pus in the lungs, a common symptom of pneumonia. 

Additionally, pneumonia can cause the bronchial to narrow or cut off, as evidenced in the statement, "When trace down both main bronchi, the bronchial has not narrowed or cut off." This is a result of the inflammation and swelling caused by the infection. 

On the other hand, the finding of pleural effusion is related to the statement, "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is not blunted." Pleural effusion is a condition where there is excess fluid in the pleural space, the area between the lungs and the chest wall. This can result in a blunted costophrenic angle, which is a classic sign of pleural effusion on a chest x-ray. 

The location information of these findings, specifically 'Parenchyme', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', 'Pleural', and 'Right Pleural', further supports the diagnoses of pneumonia and pleural effusion. The parenchyme of the lung is where the majority of the gas exchange occurs, and it is commonly affected in pneumonia. The right lower lobe is a common site for pneumonia. Pleural and right pleural locations suggest the presence of a pleural effusion.

So, the findings serve as evidence for the presence of pneumonia and pleural effusion, providing a Causal Exploration for these conditions.
