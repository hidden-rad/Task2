Causal Exploration:

The discovery of a 'pleural effusion' was identified in the 'Right Pleural' area within a specific section of the medical report. This is causally associated with the observed condition where there is a 'blunting of the costophrenic angle'. This blunting is a common symptom seen in instances of 'pleural effusion', where an excess fluid accumulation in the pleural space makes the angle appear more blunt than usual. Therefore, the 'pleural effusion' is likely the cause for the observed blunting of the costophrenic angle.
