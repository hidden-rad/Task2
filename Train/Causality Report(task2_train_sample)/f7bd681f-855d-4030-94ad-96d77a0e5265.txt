Causal Exploration: The occurrence of pleural effusion and atelectasis can result in a range of anatomical alterations and symptoms. The blunting of the costophrenic angle can be a consequence of pleural effusion as the surplus fluid occupies the space between the lung and the chest wall, modifying the angle. In a similar vein, atelectasis can lead to a reduction in the tracheal diameter and impact lung expansion as the collapsed lung fails to inflate with air. Identifying these alterations can assist in diagnosing conditions like pleural effusion and atelectasis.

Location details and their corresponding positions further corroborate these findings. For example, if the pleural effusion or atelectasis is detected in the left upper lobe (LUL), it can account for the changed anatomical features in the same area.

Therefore, the causative relationship between these abnormalities and the observed changes provides a comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition.
