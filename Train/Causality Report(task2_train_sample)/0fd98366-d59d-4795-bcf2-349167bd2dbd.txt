1. 'mass': An abnormal increase in density area, potentially indicative of a mass, was detected. This could be due to a variety of reasons including tumors, infection, or inflammation. The location of this potential mass can be determined based on further diagnostic tests. Additional procedures like a biopsy may be needed to identify the exact nature of the mass. 

2. 'cardiomegaly': An enlarged heart, also known as cardiomegaly, was identified. This could be due to various reasons such as high blood pressure, heart valve disease, or heart failure. The location of the heart, its size, and the state of the cardiac borders can help in determining the severity and cause of the cardiomegaly, based on further examinations. 

3. 'pleural effusion': A fluid buildup between the layers of the lung's protective covering (pleura), indicative of pleural effusion, was detected. This can be caused by a number of conditions including pneumonia, liver disease, or heart failure. The location of the effusion can be determined based on further diagnostic tests, and other tests may be needed to identify the cause. 

4. 'pneumonia': An infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs, known as pneumonia, was found. The bacteria or virus causing the pneumonia can cause the air sacs to fill with fluid or pus, leading to symptoms like cough with phlegm, fever, and difficulty breathing. The location and extent of the pneumonia can be determined through further examinations.

These findings can be used to guide further diagnostics and treatment.
