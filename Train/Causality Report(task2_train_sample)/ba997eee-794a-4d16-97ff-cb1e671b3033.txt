To find a part in A4 relevant to A5, we need to match the terms in A4 with those in A5. In this case, the terms 'pleural effusion', 'atelectasis', and 'cardiomegaly' from A4 are all present in A5. 

Now, to add a causal statement relating the findings of A1~4, we can say:

Causal Explanation: 

The presence of 'pleural effusion', 'atelectasis' and 'cardiomegaly' as indicated in A1 might be the cause of the conditions described in A5. 

'Pleural effusion' (fluid accumulation around the lungs) might be causing the blunting of the costophrenic angle and the absence of free gas under the diaphragms as seen in the descriptions in A5. 

'Atelectasis' (collapsed or closure of a lung) could be leading to the observation that one lung is not prominently larger than the other, and the symmetry when comparing the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones of the lungs.

'Cardiomegaly' (enlarged heart) could be the reason for the observed heart position, the cardiothoracic ratio not exceeding 50, and the size of the aortic arch and pulmonary trunk being within normal ranges. 

These conditions also correlate with the location information in A2 and A3, specifically, the 'Parenchyme', 'Right Lower Lobe', 'Left Lower Lobe', 'Right Pleural', 'Left Pleural', and 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)' locations. 

This causal explanation helps to understand how the findings in A1~4 are interconnected and could be contributing to the observed conditions.
