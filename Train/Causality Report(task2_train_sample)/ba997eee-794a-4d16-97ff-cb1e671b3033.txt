Causal Exploration: 

The presence of 'pleural effusion', 'atelectasis' and 'cardiomegaly' might be the cause of the conditions described. 

'Pleural effusion' (fluid accumulation around the lungs) might be causing the blunting of the costophrenic angle and the absence of free gas under the diaphragms as seen in the descriptions. 

'Atelectasis' (collapsed or closure of a lung) could be leading to the observation that one lung is not prominently larger than the other, and the symmetry when comparing the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones of the lungs.

'Cardiomegaly' (enlarged heart) could be the reason for the observed heart position, the cardiothoracic ratio not exceeding 50, and the size of the aortic arch and pulmonary trunk being within normal ranges. 

These conditions also correlate with the location information, specifically, the 'Parenchyme', 'Right Lower Lobe', 'Left Lower Lobe', 'Right Pleural', 'Left Pleural', and 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)' locations. 

This Causal Exploration helps to understand how the findings are interconnected and could be contributing to the observed conditions.
