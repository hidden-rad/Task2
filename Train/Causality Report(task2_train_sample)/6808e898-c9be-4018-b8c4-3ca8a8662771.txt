The relevant parts in A4 to A5 are 'pleural effusion', 'cardiomegaly', and 'edema'. 

Causal Explanation:

'Pleural effusion' refers to an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. This can be caused by various conditions such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, and lung cancer. In the case of the finding A1, 'pleural effusion' could have been caused by any of these conditions. The location information A2 and A3 suggest that the effusion is present in the 'Parenchyme' and 'Right Lower Lobe', 'Left Lower Lobe', 'Right Pleural', and 'Left Pleural'. 

'Cardiomegaly' is a medical condition where the heart is enlarged. It is often a symptom of conditions such as heart failure or coronary artery disease. In the context of the finding A1, 'cardiomegaly' could have been caused by these underlying conditions. The location information A2 and A3 suggest that the enlargement is present in the 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Ventricle', 'Right Ventricle', 'Left Atrium', and 'Right Atrium'.

'Edema' is a condition characterized by an excess of watery fluid collecting in the cavities or tissues of the body. It is often caused by heart failure, liver cirrhosis, or kidney disease. In the context of the finding A1, 'edema' could have been caused by these underlying conditions. The location information A2 and A3 do not provide specific locations for the edema, indicating that it could be widespread.

In conclusion, the findings of A1~4 suggest the presence of 'pleural effusion', 'cardiomegaly', and 'edema' which could be caused by various underlying conditions. Further diagnostic tests are required to identify the exact cause of these conditions.
