The part in A4 relevant to A5 would be the diseases 'pleural effusion' and 'pneumonia'. These are relevant as they are both conditions that can be diagnosed through the descriptions given in A5.

As for the causal explanation, we could say:

Causal Exploration:
The findings of A1~4 suggest the presence of 'pleural effusion' and 'pneumonia'. This is based on the location information of the findings in A2, which includes 'Parenchyme', 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', 'Pleural', 'Left Pleural', and 'Right Pleural'. These locations are common sites for both these diseases to occur. The time range information in A3 further suggests the progression of these diseases. 

In the context of the statements in A5, these findings can be causally explained. For instance, in the case of 'pleural effusion', the statement "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting" indicates the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, a common symptom of pleural effusion. Similarly, in the case of 'pneumonia', the statement "When compare the apical,upper,middle and lower zones in turn, there is no abnormally increased density area" may indicate the presence of an infection or inflammation in the lungs, which is characteristic of pneumonia. 

The combination of these findings, their locations, and the corresponding descriptions in A5, provide a causal explanation for the presence of these diseases.
