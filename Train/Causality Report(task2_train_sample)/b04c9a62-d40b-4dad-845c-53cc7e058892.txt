The words 'pneumonia' and 'mass' in A4 are both related to A5. 

Pneumonia is often characterized by an abnormally increased density area in the lung zones, which can be asymmetrical. This can be observed in the statement: "When compare the apical, upper, middle and lower zones in turn, there is an abnormally increased density area." This also correlates with the location information in A2, where pneumonia can occur in any lobe of the lung.

A mass, on the other hand, can cause various changes in the lung and chest structures such as tracheal deviation, widened carina, narrowed bronchial, etc. However, in the statements provided in A5, there are no such abnormalities noted.

Causal Explanation:
The findings of pneumonia in the locations specified in A2 (Parenchyme, LUL, LLL, RML, RLL) can cause an abnormally increased density area in the lung zones, leading to asymmetry. This is consistent with the findings in A1. However, no mass was found that could cause deviations or abnormalities in the lung and chest structures as per the statements in A5. This indicates that the pneumonia might not be caused by a mass in the lungs.
