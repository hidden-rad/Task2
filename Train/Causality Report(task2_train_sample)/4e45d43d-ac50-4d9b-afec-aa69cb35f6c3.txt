Causal Exploration:

The findings of A1 which were 'pleural effusion' and 'cardiomegaly' were associated with certain location information and other findings as described in A2 and A3 respectively. 

'Pleural effusion' is a condition where there is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space (the area between the lung and the chest wall). This is evident from the location information given in A2 which includes 'Pleural', 'Left Pleural', 'Right Pleural', etc. The cause of this condition can be many, including heart conditions such as congestive heart failure which could be related to the 'cardiomegaly' finding in A1. 

'Cardiomegaly' refers to an enlarged heart. This is evident from the location information given in A2 which includes 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Atrium', 'Left Atrium', 'Right Ventricle', and 'Left Ventricle'. This condition can occur due to a variety of reasons including high blood pressure, heart valve disorders, etc. 

In the context of A5, the descriptions related to 'pleural effusion' and 'cardiomegaly' suggest that these conditions are currently present. For instance, statements like ""When trace the hemidiaphragms in to the vertebra, right diaphragm is not higher than left."", ""When trace the cardiac borders, the left and right heart borders are not clearly seen."" indicate the presence of fluid in the pleural space and an enlarged heart respectively.

To sum up, the findings of 'pleural effusion' and 'cardiomegaly' in A1, their relevant location information in A2, and the corresponding descriptions in A5, indicate that the patient may be suffering from heart-related conditions which are causing these symptoms.
