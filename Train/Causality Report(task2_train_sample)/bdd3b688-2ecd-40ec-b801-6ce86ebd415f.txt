Causal Exploration:

The discovery of atelectasis within the 'Parenchyme' and 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)', along with the provided location information, can be causally associated with the observation that one lung is not significantly larger than the other. This is due to the fact that atelectasis results in the collapse or closure of airways or alveoli, leading to a loss of volume in the affected part of the lung, which might make the other lung appear significantly larger. This is in line with a previously mentioned statement. Therefore, the atelectasis could potentially be the cause for the observed asymmetry in lung volume.
