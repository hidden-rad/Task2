The atelectasis in A4 is relevant to the part in A5 that states, "When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other." Atelectasis is a condition where the airways or alveoli within the lung collapse or close, leading to a loss of volume in the affected part of the lung. This could potentially cause one lung to appear prominently larger than the other in a radiograph, as mentioned in A5.

Causal Explanation:

The finding of atelectasis (A1) found in the 'Parenchyme' and 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)' (A2), with the location information provided (A3), can be causally linked to the observation that one lung is not prominently larger than the other. This is because atelectasis leads to the collapse or closure of airways or alveoli, causing a loss of volume in the affected part of the lung, which may make the other lung appear prominently larger. This is consistent with the statement in A5. Hence, the atelectasis could be a potential cause for the observed asymmetry in lung volume.
