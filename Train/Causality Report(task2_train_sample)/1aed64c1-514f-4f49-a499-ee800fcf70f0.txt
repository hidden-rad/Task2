Causal Exploration:

The finding of atelectasis found in the 'Parenchyme' and 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)', with the location information provided, can be causally linked to the observation that one lung is not prominently larger than the other. This is because atelectasis leads to the collapse or closure of airways or alveoli, causing a loss of volume in the affected part of the lung, which may make the other lung appear prominently larger. This is consistent with the previously mentioned statement. Hence, the atelectasis could be a potential cause for the observed asymmetry in lung volume.
