Causal Exploration:

1. The presence of 'pneumonia' and 'cardiomegaly' can be traced to certain abnormalities in the lungs and heart, respectively.

2. The abnormality in the lung was found in the 'Parenchyme' and 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)' regions. These are common sites for pneumonia to occur, leading to symptoms like coughing, chest pain, and difficulty breathing.

3. For 'cardiomegaly', the abnormalities were found in 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Atrium', 'Right Atrium', 'Right Ventricle', and 'Left Ventricle'. This condition, which refers to an enlarged heart, could result from high blood pressure or coronary artery disease.

4. The location of these abnormalities corroborates the previous findings, further confirming the presence of 'pneumonia' and 'cardiomegaly'.

5. The statements provide a detailed examination of the symptoms and possible causes of these two medical conditions. For example, the statement ""When compare the apical, upper, middle and lower zones in turn, there is an abnormally increased density area."" could be a reference to the fluid buildup in the lungs due to pneumonia. Similarly, the statement ""When assess cardiac size, cardiothoracic ratio does not exceed 50 and is in the normal range."" indicates that the heart is not excessively enlarged, which is a common symptom of 'cardiomegaly'.

Thus, the findings provide a Causal Exploration for the symptoms and conditions described, providing useful insights into the patient's health status.
