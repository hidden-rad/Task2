Causal Exploration: The finding of atelectasis in the 'Parenchyme', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)' could explain why "one lung is not prominently larger than the other" as observed in A5. Atelectasis in the right lower lobe might have caused this lobe to collapse or close, resulting in its reduced volume. This would make the lungs appear asymmetrical in volume, as one lung (or part of it) is not expanding as it should. This condition is usually caused by a blockage of the bronchi or bronchioles, or by pressure on the outside of the lung.
