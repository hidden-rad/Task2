From A4, the term 'atelectasis' is relevant to A5. Atelectasis refers to the collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. It may be acute or chronic and is usually unilateral, affecting part or all of one lung. It is a condition where the alveoli are deflated down to little or no volume, as distinct from pulmonary consolidation.

From A5, the statement "When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other." is related to atelectasis, as it describes a situation where one lung is not expanding as it should, which could be due to atelectasis.

From A1, we have found atelectasis in the patient's lung. 

From A2, the location of this finding is in the 'Parenchyme', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)'. 

From A3, the specific span of text where this finding is mentioned is from the 9th to the 11th word of the report.

Causal Exploration: The finding of atelectasis in the 'Parenchyme', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)' could explain why "one lung is not prominently larger than the other" as observed in A5. Atelectasis in the right lower lobe might have caused this lobe to collapse or close, resulting in its reduced volume. This would make the lungs appear asymmetrical in volume, as one lung (or part of it) is not expanding as it should. This condition is usually caused by a blockage of the bronchi or bronchioles, or by pressure on the outside of the lung.
