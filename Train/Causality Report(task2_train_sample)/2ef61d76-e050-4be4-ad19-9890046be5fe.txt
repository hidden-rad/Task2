In order to explore the causes, we need to comprehend the implications of the observed findings. 

'Cardiomegaly' is a term that refers to an enlarged heart. 'Pleural effusion' is the term used to describe the accumulation of fluid between the layers of tissue that line the lungs and chest cavity. 'Atelectasis' is defined as a complete or partial collapse of the entire lung or a specific area (lobe) of the lung. 

In the context of these findings, the enlarged heart (cardiomegaly) might be exerting pressure on the lungs, potentially leading to the observed pleural effusion and atelectasis. This is particularly evident in certain findings where the location of the observations is associated with the heart and lungs. 

Therefore, the exploration of causes could be:

"Causal Exploration: The observed enlargement of the patient's heart (cardiomegaly) seems to be exerting pressure on the surrounding lung tissue. This pressure might be leading to the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space (pleural effusion) and the subsequent collapse of parts of the lung (atelectasis). The location of these observations further supports this hypothesis, indicating a potential causal relationship between these conditions. Further investigation is necessary to confirm this causal link and determine the appropriate treatment."
