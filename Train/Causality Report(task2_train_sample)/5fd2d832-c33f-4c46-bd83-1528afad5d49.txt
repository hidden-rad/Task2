Causal Exploration: The finding of a pleural effusion located in the 'Pleural', 'Right Pleural', or unspecified areas with position information [{'begin': 7, 'end': 9}] can be linked to the observations in the list. Specifically, the statement 'When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting.' could indicate fluid build-up in the pleural space, potentially leading to a pleural effusion. This condition may cause symptoms like shortness of breath and chest pain. Further investigation is needed for a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan.
