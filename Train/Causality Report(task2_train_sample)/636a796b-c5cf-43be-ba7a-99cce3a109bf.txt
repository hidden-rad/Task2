Causal Exploration:

Atelectasis and mass in the lungs can cause several changes in the body which are reflected in the findings. 

In the case of atelectasis, it can cause a noticeable change in the volume of the lungs as one lung can become prominently larger than the other. This is due to the air space in a part of the lung being replaced by the collapsed lung tissue. 

As for the mass, it can lead to an abnormally increased density area in the lungs. This is because the mass, being an abnormal growth, takes up space in the lungs and increases the density in the area it occupies. 

Both conditions can cause no noticeable change in the trachea, bronchi, and carina as they primarily affect the lung parenchyma. Furthermore, these conditions can cause asymmetry in the apical, upper, middle and lower zones of the lungs as they do not affect all areas of the lungs equally.

In conclusion, the findings, which include the presence of atelectasis and a mass in the lungs and no noticeable changes in the trachea, bronchi, and carina, can be causally explained by the effects of these conditions on the lungs. This explanation provides a better understanding of the potential causes of the observed changes in the lungs and can be useful in guiding further medical investigations and treatment plans.
