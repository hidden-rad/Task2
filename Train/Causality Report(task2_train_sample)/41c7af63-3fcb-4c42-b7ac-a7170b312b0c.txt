In the context of Causal Exploration, we can discuss the following:

The terms 'Pleural effusion' and 'atelectasis' are present in the findings. The location information suggests that these conditions occur in the 'Pleural', 'Left Pleural', 'Right Pleural', and 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)'. 

The cause of 'pleural effusion' could be due to factors like heart failure, pneumonia, or liver disease. This may be indicated by statements such as "When tracing the cardiac borders, the left and right heart borders are not clearly seen." or "When tracing the hemidiaphragms into the vertebra, the right diaphragm is not higher than the left." 

As for 'atelectasis', it could be caused by conditions like a blocked airway or pressure from outside the lung. This can be seen by statements like "When tracing the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, the costophrenic angle is blunting." or "When tracing down both main bronchi, the bronchial has not narrowed or cut off."

This Causal Exploration provides a possible link between the findings and the conditions 'pleural effusion' and 'atelectasis', with reference to the detailed information provided.
