Upon examining the given data, it appears that there are no direct mentions of 'pneumonia' (A4) in the provided statements (A5). However, several descriptions in A5 can be indirectly associated with pneumonia, such as abnormal increase in lung density, which may indicate inflamed areas of the lung tissue - a common symptom of pneumonia.

Combining this with A1 (finding: pneumonia), A2 (location: Parenchyme, RLL, LLL), and A3 (location information: {'begin': 2, 'end': 11}), we can formulate a causal explanation as follows:

Causal Exploration: The abnormal increase in lung density, noted in both the right lower lobe (RLL) and the left lower lobe (LLL) of the lung parenchyme (A2), aligns with the finding of 'pneumonia' (A1) in the patient's diagnosis. This can be attributed to the inflammation and consolidation of the lung tissue commonly associated with pneumonia. The specific location of these changes in the lung parenchyme, between the 2nd and 11th positions (A3), further corroborates the diagnosis. The symptoms described in the provided statements (A5) indirectly support this diagnosis, although 'pneumonia' is not explicitly mentioned.
