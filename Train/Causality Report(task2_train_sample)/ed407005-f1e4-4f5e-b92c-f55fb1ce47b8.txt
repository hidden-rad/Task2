Causal Exploration:

The findings from A1~4 suggest the presence of cardiomegaly and edema. Cardiomegaly is indicated by the cardiothoracic ratio being over 50, which is not within the normal range. This could be due to the heart being enlarged, a characteristic sign of cardiomegaly.

Furthermore, the absence of any narrowing or widening of the tracheal diameter and bronchial, as well as the non-blunted costophrenic angle, could be attributed to edema. Edema is a condition characterized by an excess of watery fluid collecting in the cavities or tissues of the body, which could explain these findings. 

In conclusion, the analysis of A1~4 demonstrates that cardiomegaly and edema are potential health concerns that need to be addressed.
