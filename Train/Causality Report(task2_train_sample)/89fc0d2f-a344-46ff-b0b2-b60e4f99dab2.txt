In the process of causal exploration, it's necessary to identify the relevant components. In this case, the terms 'pleural effusion' and 'atelectasis' are of particular importance.

Pleural effusion is a medical condition characterized by an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. This can be triggered by various conditions such as heart failure, pneumonia, and cancer. On the other hand, atelectasis refers to the collapse or closure of a lung, resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including a blocked airway or pressure from a tumor or fluid.

The causal exploration can be conducted as follows:

1. Pleural effusion: Statements such as "When tracing the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, the costophrenic angle is blunting" and "When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other" suggest the presence of pleural effusion. The blunting of the costophrenic angle and asymmetry in lung volumes are key indicators of pleural effusion.

2. Atelectasis: Statements like "When tracing down the trachea to the carina, there is no tracheal deviation" and "When comparing the apical, upper, middle and lower zones in turn, there is no abnormally increased density area" suggest the absence of atelectasis. Tracheal deviation and increased density areas in the lung fields would be indicative of atelectasis.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the findings are due to the presence of pleural effusion and absence of atelectasis, as explained by the aforementioned statements.
