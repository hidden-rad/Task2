Causal Exploration: The discovery of 'cardiomegaly' in various locations such as the 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Atrium', 'Left Atrium', 'Right Ventricle', and 'Left Ventricle' suggests an enlargement of the heart. This enlargement could be attributed to several causes including high blood pressure, heart valve disease, or heart muscle diseases. It has been observed that this enlargement is causing a cardiothoracic ratio of over 50, which is beyond the normal range. This indicates that the heart is occupying an excessive amount of space in the thoracic cavity. If not properly managed, this can lead to various symptoms and complications.
