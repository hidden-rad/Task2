"Causal Exploration:

The observed abnormalities, such as costophrenic angle blunting and increased density area, could potentially be explained by conditions like 'pleural effusion' and 'pneumonia'. The provided location information further substantiates these findings. It's crucial to understand that while pleural effusion could be a result of pneumonia, it might also be caused by other conditions like tuberculosis or cancer. In the same vein, the existence of pneumonia can trigger lung inflammation, which in turn could lead to pleural effusion."
