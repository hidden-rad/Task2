Causal Exploration: The presence of atelectasis is likely to have caused a noticeable difference in lung volume. This condition, located in the 'Parenchyme', 'LLL (Left Lower Lobe)', and 'LUL (Left Upper Lobe)' with the given location information, could have led to one lung being prominently larger than the other. This is because, in atelectasis, the affected lobe of the lung collapses, making it appear smaller in size and volume compared to the unaffected lung or lobe. Thus, the overall volume of the lungs might appear asymmetrical.
