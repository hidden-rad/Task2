Causal Exploration: The presence of atelectasis, as indicated in A1, is likely to have caused a noticeable difference in lung volume as described in A5. This condition, located in the 'Parenchyme', 'LLL (Left Lower Lobe)', and 'LUL (Left Upper Lobe)' as indicated in A2 with the given location information in A3, could have led to one lung being prominently larger than the other. This is because, in atelectasis, the affected lobe of the lung collapses, making it appear smaller in size and volume compared to the unaffected lung or lobe. Thus, the overall volume of the lungs might appear asymmetrical."
