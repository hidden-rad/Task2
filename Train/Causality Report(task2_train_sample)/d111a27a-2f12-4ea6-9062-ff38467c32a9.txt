Causal Exploration: The findings of 'pleural effusion' and 'mass' are located within the lung according to the location information provided. These conditions can cause several symptoms or abnormalities. For instance, a 'mass' in the lung could cause changes in lung volume, or abnormal density areas. Similarly, 'pleural effusion' could lead to blunting of the costophrenic angle, or changes in the tracheal diameter. Therefore, the presence of 'pleural effusion' and 'mass' could be potential causes of the observed symptoms or abnormalities.
