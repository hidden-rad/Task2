The relevant parts in A4 to A5 are 'cardiomegaly' and 'atelectasis'. 

Cardiomegaly refers to an enlarged heart, which can be caused by a number of conditions including heart failure, high blood pressure, and diseases of the heart muscle. The symptoms of cardiomegaly include shortness of breath, abnormal heart rhythms, and swelling of the legs due to fluid retention. 

Atelectasis refers to a partial or complete collapse of a lung or lobe of a lung. It can be caused by a number of factors including blockage of the airways (bronchus or bronchioles) by mucus or foreign bodies, pressure on the outside of the lung, or nerve damage. The symptoms of atelectasis include difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, and decreased oxygen levels in the blood. 

Causal Explanation:
The findings of A1~4 indicate the presence of both cardiomegaly and atelectasis. The location information of these findings (A2 and A3) provides further evidence for these diagnoses. The cardiomegaly is likely due to an underlying heart condition, as suggested by the finding of a cardiothoracic ratio over 50 (not in the normal range). This could potentially cause fluid retention and swelling of the legs. The atelectasis could be due to a blockage of the airways or pressure on the outside of the lung. This would explain the finding of one lung not prominently larger than the other and the absence of an abnormally increased density area. These conditions could potentially be interrelated, with the heart condition causing fluid build-up in the lungs, leading to atelectasis. Further investigation is required to confirm these diagnoses and to identify the underlying causes.
