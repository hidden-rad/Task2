To generate causal explanations, we need to identify the relevant parts. Here, the words are 'pleural effusion' and 'atelectasis'.

Pleural effusion is a condition where there is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. It can be caused by various conditions like heart failure, pneumonia, and cancer. Atelectasis, on the other hand, refers to the collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. It may be caused by various factors like a blocked airway or pressure due to a tumor or fluid. 

Causal exploration can be performed as follows:

1. Pleural effusion: The statements such as "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting" and "When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other" indicate the presence of pleural effusion. The blunting of the costophrenic angle and asymmetry in lung volumes are key findings in pleural effusion. 

2. Atelectasis: The statements like "When trace down the trachea to the carina, there is no tracheal deviation" and "When compare the apical, upper, middle and lower zones in turn, there is no abnormally increased density area" indicate the absence of atelectasis. Tracheal deviation and increased density areas in the lung fields would be indicative of atelectasis. 

Thus, we can say that the findings are due to the presence of pleural effusion and absence of atelectasis as explained by the statements.
