'Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease' (COPD) is a type of obstructive lung disease characterized by long-term breathing problems and poor airflow. The primary cause of COPD is tobacco smoke, including second-hand or passive exposure. In this particular case, the disease was found in specific locations such as the 'Parenchyme', 'Right Middle Lobe', 'Right Upper Lobe', 'Right Lower Lobe', 'Left Upper Lobe', and 'Left Lower Lobe'. The location information of the finding was specified by the given coordinates.

The impact of COPD on the lungs and the respiratory system can be evaluated in relation to certain observations. For example, COPD can cause the bronchial tubes to narrow, contradicting the statement 'the bronchial has not narrowed or cut off'. Similarly, COPD can lead to increased density in the lungs, which contradicts the observation 'there is no abnormally increased density area'. In more advanced stages, it may also cause abnormalities in the lung vessels, the costophrenic angle, and the cardiac borders, among others.

Therefore, a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may present abnormalities in the areas described in these observations, which could be considered as potential signs of the disease. These changes could be due to the progression of the disease itself or its underlying causes. This causal exploration links the findings and explains the potential impact of 'chronic obstructive pulmonary disease' on the observations made.
