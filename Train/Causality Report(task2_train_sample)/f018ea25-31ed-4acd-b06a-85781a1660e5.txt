Causal Exploration: The swelling found in the tissue of the right middle lobe, right lower lobe, and left upper lobe is likely the source of the detected irregularities in these regions, such as the heightened density and possible constriction of the bronchial tubes. In addition, the condition of cardiomegaly, or heart enlargement, could be the cause of the irregularities seen in the right and left atrium and ventricles. 

The discoveries made suggest a possible link between the swelling and heart enlargement and the detected irregularities in the patient's lungs and heart. Additional examination is necessary to validate this.
