Causal Explanation: The atelectasis discovered in the parenchyme, right upper lobe, right lower lobe, and left lower lobe might be responsible for the observed irregular expansion of the lungs and heightened density in specific regions. The deflated or collapsed air sacs in these areas, a result of atelectasis, could contribute to a decrease in lung volume and an increase in density as seen on imaging.
