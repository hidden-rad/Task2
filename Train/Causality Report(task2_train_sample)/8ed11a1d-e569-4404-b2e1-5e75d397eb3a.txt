Causal Exploration: The discovery of conditions such as 'pleural effusion' and 'atelectasis' in specific areas of the lung are due to abnormalities in the lung's typical structure and function. The existence of pleural effusion could be suggested by a dulling of the angle where the diaphragm and rib cage meet, while atelectasis might be suggested if one lung appears less expanded or smaller in volume compared to the other. Additional examinations are required for a conclusive diagnosis.
