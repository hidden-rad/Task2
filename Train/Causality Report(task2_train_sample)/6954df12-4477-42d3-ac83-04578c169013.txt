Causal Exploration: Pleural effusion is a condition where there is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space (the cavity between the lung and the chest wall). This can be detected in specified locations. The symptoms and observations, such as blunting of the costophrenic angle, could be caused by this accumulation of fluid. The presence of pleural effusion can cause these observations, as the fluid can push against the lung, causing it to retract, and the pleura to appear denser or more white on an imaging study. This could explain why the costophrenic angle is blunting. Other changes in the images could also be due to the presence of this fluid. Therefore, the pleural effusion is causally related to the findings noted.
