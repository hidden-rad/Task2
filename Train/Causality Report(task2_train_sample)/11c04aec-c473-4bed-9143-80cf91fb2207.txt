Causal Exploration: The occurrence of 'pleural effusion' and 'atelectasis' can be attributed to certain observed changes. Specifically, the blunting of the costophrenic angle is a common sign of pleural effusion. This alteration in the costophrenic angle might be due to the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, a process that could be triggered by various causes like infection, inflammation, heart failure, or malignancy.

Similarly, the discovery of atelectasis could be due to a lack of expansion in one lung as observed. This could be due to an obstruction in the airway, leading to a collapse of the lung tissue. The causes of this obstruction could be a foreign body, mucus plug, or tumor.

Thus, the findings are causally linked to the observed descriptions, providing a Causal Exploration of these abnormalities.
