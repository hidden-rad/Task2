Causal Exploration: The detection of metastasis in various locations, including the Parenchyme, Right Upper Lobe, Right Middle Lobe, Right Lower Lobe, Left Upper Lobe, and Left Lower Lobe, which was identified within a certain range, may be causing changes or abnormalities in the lungs. These can include tracheal deviation, narrowing or widening of the bronchi, increased density in the lung zones, or abnormalities in the lung vessels and hilum. This metastasis could potentially be responsible for these observed changes and may require further investigation and treatment.
