Causal Exploration: The presence of atelectasis, as indicated by the finding of A1, may have caused a reduction in the size or expansion of one lung as described in the statement from A5. The location information of A2 and A3 further confirm that the atelectasis is located in the 'Parenchyme' and the 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)', which could explain the observed discrepancy in lung size and expansion. Therefore, the atelectasis could be the cause of the abnormal lung size and expansion observed during the chest examination.
