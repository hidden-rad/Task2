Causal Exploration: The presence of atelectasis may have caused a reduction in the size or expansion of one lung. The location information further confirms that the atelectasis is located in the 'Parenchyme' and the 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)', which could explain the observed discrepancy in lung size and expansion. Therefore, the atelectasis could be the cause of the abnormal lung size and expansion observed during the chest examination.
