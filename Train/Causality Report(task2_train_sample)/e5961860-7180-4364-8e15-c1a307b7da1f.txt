Causal Exploration: The discovery of 'cardiomegaly' was made in various locations including the 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Ventricle', 'Right Ventricle', and both 'Left Atrium' and 'Right Atrium'. This was determined based on specific location information. The presence of cardiomegaly could be the reason behind the abnormal cardiothoracic ratio observed in the statement, "When assessing cardiac size, the cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 and not in the normal range." This is because this condition often leads to an increased heart size, which can subsequently alter the cardiothoracic ratio.
