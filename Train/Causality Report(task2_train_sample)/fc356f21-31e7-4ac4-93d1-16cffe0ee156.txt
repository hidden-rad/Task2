To generate a causal explanation, we need to understand the meanings of the findings in A1~A4. 

'Cardiomegaly' means an enlargement of the heart. 'Pleural effusion' refers to the buildup of fluid between the layers of tissue that line the lungs and chest cavity. 'Atelectasis' is a complete or partial collapse of the entire lung or area (lobe) of the lung. 

In the context of A1~A4, the enlargement of the heart (cardiomegaly) could be causing pressure on the lungs leading to the pleural effusion and atelectasis observed. This can be particularly seen in the findings of A2 and A3 where the location of the findings is associated with the heart and lungs. 

Therefore, the causal explanation could be:

"Causal Exploration: The enlargement of the heart observed in the patient (cardiomegaly) appears to be causing pressure on the surrounding lung tissue. This pressure could potentially be leading to the buildup of fluid in the pleural space (pleural effusion) and the subsequent collapse of parts of the lung (atelectasis). The location of these findings, as noted in A2 and A3, further supports this hypothesis, highlighting a potential causal link between these conditions. Further investigation is required to confirm this causal relationship and guide appropriate treatment."
