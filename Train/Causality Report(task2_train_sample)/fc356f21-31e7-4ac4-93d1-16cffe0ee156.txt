Causal Exploration: The enlargement of the heart observed in the patient (cardiomegaly) appears to be causing pressure on the surrounding lung tissue. This pressure could potentially be leading to the buildup of fluid in the pleural space (pleural effusion) and the subsequent collapse of parts of the lung (atelectasis). The location of these findings further supports this hypothesis, highlighting a potential causal link between these conditions. Further investigation is required to confirm this causal relationship and guide appropriate treatment.
