Causal Exploration: The discovery of atelectasis in the 'Parenchyme', 'Right Lower Lobe' could provide an explanation for the observation that "one lung is not significantly larger than the other". The presence of atelectasis in the right lower lobe may have led to the collapse or closure of this lobe, resulting in a decrease in its volume. This could result in the lungs appearing asymmetrical in volume, as one lung (or a portion of it) is not expanding as it should. This condition is typically brought about by an obstruction in the bronchi or bronchioles, or by external pressure on the lung.
