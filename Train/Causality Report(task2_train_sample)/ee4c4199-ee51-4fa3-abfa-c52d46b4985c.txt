After examination, it can be noted that there is a relevance between the words and the findings. All three words 'pneumonia', 'pleural effusion', and 'cardiomegaly' which are listed are mentioned in the findings, indicating a medical condition of the patient.

The causal statement that can be formulated to connect these findings can be as follows:

'Causal Exploration': The findings of pneumonia, pleural effusion, and cardiomegaly are linked to the location information. The abnormalities observed in the 'Parenchyme', 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)', 'Right Pleural', 'Left Pleural', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Atrium', 'Left Atrium', 'Right Ventricle', and 'Left Ventricle' are indicative of these conditions. Furthermore, these conditions are supported by the observations where abnormalities in the trachea, bronchi, lungs, hila, lung vessels, diaphragms, heart, aortic arch, and pulmonary trunk are mentioned. These observations collectively provide a causal explanation for the presence of pneumonia, pleural effusion, and cardiomegaly in the patient.
