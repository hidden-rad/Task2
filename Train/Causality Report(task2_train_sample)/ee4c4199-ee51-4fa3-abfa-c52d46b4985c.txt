After examining A4 and A5, it can be noted that there is a relevance between the words in A4 and the findings in A5. All three words 'pneumonia', 'pleural effusion', and 'cardiomegaly' which are listed in A4 are mentioned in A5, indicating a medical condition of the patient.

The causal statement that can be formulated to connect the findings of A1~4 can be as follows:

'Causal Exploration': The findings of pneumonia, pleural effusion, and cardiomegaly in A1 are linked to the location information in A2 and A3. The abnormalities observed in the 'Parenchyme', 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)', 'Right Pleural', 'Left Pleural', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Atrium', 'Left Atrium', 'Right Ventricle', and 'Left Ventricle' are indicative of these conditions. Furthermore, these conditions are supported by the observations in A5, where abnormalities in the trachea, bronchi, lungs, hila, lung vessels, diaphragms, heart, aortic arch, and pulmonary trunk are mentioned. These observations collectively provide a causal explanation for the presence of pneumonia, pleural effusion, and cardiomegaly in the patient.
