Causal Exploration:

The cause of these conditions could be a variety of factors. For example, pleural effusion could be caused by heart failure, pneumonia, liver disease, or kidney disease. Similarly, atelectasis could be caused by blockage of the air passages or pressure on the outside of the lung.

In the given context, the presence of pleural effusion and atelectasis could be due to abnormalities in the trachea, bronchi, lungs, hilum, lung vessels, costophrenic angle, diaphragm, cardiac borders, aortic arch, and pulmonary trunk. 

For instance, a narrowed tracheal diameter could lead to atelectasis. Similarly, a blunting costophrenic angle is a common sign of pleural effusion. 

Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of these areas could provide valuable insights into the underlying cause of these conditions and guide appropriate treatment strategies.

For a more thorough understanding and effective management of these conditions, it is crucial to explore these causal relationships further. This process is also known as 'Causal Exploration'.
