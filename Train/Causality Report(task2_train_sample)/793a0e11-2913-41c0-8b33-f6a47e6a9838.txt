Causal Exploration: We need to identify a part that is relevant to our study. The relevant parts are 'pleural effusion' and 'edema'. The causal statements for these terms can be added as follows:

Causal Exploration:

1. Pleural effusion: This condition occurs when excess fluid builds up between the layers of the pleura, the thin membrane that lines the outside of the lungs and the inside of the chest wall. The cause of pleural effusion can be due to various conditions like heart failure, pneumonia, or a pulmonary embolism.

2. Edema: This condition refers to swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in the body's tissues. Edema can occur in any part of the body, but it is most commonly observed in the hands, arms, feet, ankles, and legs. It can be caused by a number of conditions, including heart, liver, or kidney disease, or from taking certain medications.

These causal statements help in understanding the underlying causes of the findings of pleural effusion and edema and link them to the locations and specific positions identified in our study.
