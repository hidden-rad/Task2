Causal Exploration: The finding of 'atelectasis' was located in the 'Parenchyme', specifically in the 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)'. This was determined from the given location information that begins at the 10th and ends at the 11th point. The relevance is that 'atelectasis' can cause a number of abnormalities in the lung structure and function as described. These include abnormal increase in density area, changes in the lung vessels, blunting of the costophrenic angle, and changes in the mediastinal width among others. Thus, the finding of 'atelectasis' can explain these observed abnormalities in the lung.
