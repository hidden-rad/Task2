Exploring Causes: We need to connect the findings to the relevant sections in the previously mentioned document. 

This document includes the words: ['atelectasis', 'pneumonia', 'pleural effusion']. In a corresponding section, we discover that these three conditions are linked to a broad array of symptoms and observations noted in the medical report. For instance, characteristics such as "abnormally increased density area" or "costophrenic angle is not blunted" could potentially indicate these conditions.

To create an Exploration of Causes, we first pinpoint the sections in the report that may suggest the existence of these conditions. Based on the location information provided earlier, we can then determine where these conditions are likely to appear in the lung.

Let's consider 'atelectasis' as an example. Atelectasis refers to the collapse or closure of a lung, leading to reduced or absent gas exchange. It can be acute or chronic and is typically unilateral, affecting part or all of one lung. Based on the location information provided, we could hypothetically suggest that the increased density area in the RLL (Right Lower Lobe) might be a result of atelectasis.

Using this approach, we can create similar Explorations of Causes for 'pneumonia' and 'pleural effusion', connecting the symptoms noted in the report to these conditions and their likely locations in the lung.

Lastly, we include the term 'Exploration of Causes' to indicate that this explanation is based on investigating potential causal links between the symptoms and the conditions.

Please note: This is a hypothetical medical scenario and the Exploration of Causes provided here is a general illustration. Actual medical diagnosis and explanations would require a detailed examination and expert medical judgement.
