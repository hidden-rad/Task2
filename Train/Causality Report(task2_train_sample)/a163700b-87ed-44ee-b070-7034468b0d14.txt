In the given list A5, the relevant part to word 'mass' in A4 is "When compare the apical, upper, middle and lower zones in turn, there is an abnormally increased density area." which may be referring to the presence of a mass. We can add a causal explanation related to this finding.

Causal Explanation:
The finding of 'mass' (A1) in the location ['Etc', 'Right Hilum', None] (A2) with location information [{'begin': 3, 'end': 9}] (A3) could be related to the abnormally increased density area mentioned in the given list (A5). This abnormal density might be caused by the mass detected in the Right Hilum. Further diagnostic procedures might be necessary to confirm the nature of the mass and to rule out any serious conditions.
