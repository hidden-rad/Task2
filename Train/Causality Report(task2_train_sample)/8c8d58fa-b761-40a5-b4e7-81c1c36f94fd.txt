Causal Exploration: The blunting of the costophrenic angle could be due to a pleural effusion, which is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. This condition can be caused by a variety of factors, including heart failure, pneumonia, or a pulmonary embolism. On the other hand, the absence of subcutaneous emphysema could suggest the presence of edema. This could be caused by conditions such as kidney disease or heart failure. Both of these conditions can lead to an abnormal chest X-ray and require further investigation for a definitive diagnosis.
