Causal Exploration: The finding of atelectasis in the 'Parenchyme' and 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)' could be due to a blockage or pressure in the air passages, causing the lung not to inflate properly. This is supported by the abnormality in lung expansion observed in the statement. This could be the underlying cause of the atelectasis identified. Further investigation and medical intervention may be required to address this issue.
