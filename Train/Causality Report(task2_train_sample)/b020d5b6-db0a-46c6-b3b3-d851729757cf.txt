A4 = 'atelectasis' is a condition where part of the lung collapses or does not inflate properly. This is often due to a blockage of the air passages (bronchus or bronchioles) or by pressure on the outside of the lung.

From A5, there is a statement relevant to A4: ""When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other."". This indicates an abnormality in the size and expansion of one of the lungs which could indicate the presence of atelectasis. 

From A2 and A3, we know that the atelectasis was found in the 'Parenchyme' and 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)' and the location information was given as [{'begin': 9, 'end': 12}]. This suggests that the atelectasis is located in the left lower lobe of the lung.

Causal Explanation: The finding of atelectasis in the 'Parenchyme' and 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)' could be due to a blockage or pressure in the air passages, causing the lung not to inflate properly. This is supported by the abnormality in lung expansion observed in the statement from A5. This could be the underlying cause of the atelectasis identified in A1. Further investigation and medical intervention may be required to address this issue.
