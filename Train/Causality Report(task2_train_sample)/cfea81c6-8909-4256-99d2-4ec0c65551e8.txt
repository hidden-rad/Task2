From the list A4 which includes ['pneumonia', 'pneumomediastinum', 'emphysema'], we can see that these are different types of lung diseases. In A5, these diseases are associated with various symptoms and conditions described in a set of statements. 

Each disease in A4 is related to the findings in A1 ('pneumonia pneumomediastinum emphysema') with its location information in A2 and A3. For instance, pneumonia could be associated with symptoms like "abnormally increased density area" and "hilar vessels are clearly seen on both sides." Similarly, pneumomediastinum could be related to "no tracheal deviation" and "mediastinal width has been not widened by more than 8cm". Lastly, emphysema could be linked with "no subcutaneous emphysema" and "one lung is not prominently larger than the other."

To causally explain these findings, we could say:

"Causal Exploration: The findings of 'pneumonia', 'pneumomediastinum', and 'emphysema' in A1, with their respective locations in A2 and A3, can be explained by the symptoms and conditions described in A5. For instance, the presence of pneumonia may cause an abnormally increased density area in the lung and clearly seen hilar vessels on both sides. Pneumomediastinum, on the other hand, may lead to no tracheal deviation and a not widened mediastinal width. Lastly, emphysema could result in no subcutaneous emphysema and a not prominently larger lung. These causal links between the diseases and the symptoms provide a comprehensive understanding of the diseases' impacts on the body."
