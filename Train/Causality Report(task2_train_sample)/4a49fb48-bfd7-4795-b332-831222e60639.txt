The relevant part in A4 to A5 are the words 'pneumonia' and 'pleural effusion'. 

Pneumonia is a condition that causes inflammation in one or both lungs, often as a result of infection. In the context of the given findings (A1~4), we can see an abnormally increased density area in the upper, middle, and lower zones of the lungs, which can be a sign of pneumonia. 

Pleural effusion, on the other hand, is when excess fluid builds up between the layers of the pleura, the thin membrane that lines the outside of the lungs and the inside of the chest cavity. In the given findings it is noted that the costophrenic angle is not blunted, which means there is no excess fluid in the pleural space and therefore no pleural effusion.

Causal Explanation: The findings indicate a condition of pneumonia but not pleural effusion. The increased density in various lung zones can be caused by the inflammation and fluid buildup in the lung tissues that occurs in pneumonia. The absence of a blunted costophrenic angle suggests that there is no excess fluid in the pleural space, ruling out pleural effusion. Therefore, the causal explanation for the given findings is pneumonia.
