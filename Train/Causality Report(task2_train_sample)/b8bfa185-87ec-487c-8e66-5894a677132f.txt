Causal Exploration: The findings of pneumonia and pleural effusion are substantiated by the abnormalities identified in the lung and pleural areas. The irregularities in these regions, specifically in the 'Parenchyme', 'RUL(Right Upper Lobe)', 'RML(Right Middle Lobe)', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', 'Right Pleural', and 'Left Pleural', directly point towards these conditions. The location information further strengthens the diagnosis, with the given coordinates indicating the exact areas of concern. Furthermore, the detailed observations provide evidence of the symptoms and effects of both pneumonia and pleural effusion, reinforcing the initial findings. 

This explanation provides a causal relationship between the findings and the terms, offering a comprehensive understanding of the diagnosis.
