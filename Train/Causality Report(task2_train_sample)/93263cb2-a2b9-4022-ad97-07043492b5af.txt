Based on the given information, here is how you can relate the findings of A1-A4 to A5 with a causal explanation:

The findings A1 indicate the presence of 'cardiomegaly', 'pleural effusion', and 'pneumonia' in the patient. The words in A4 ['cardiomegaly', 'pleural effusion', 'pneumonia'] correspond to the diseases found in A1. 

The location information of the findings in A2 indicates that the 'cardiomegaly' is found in the 'Parenchyme' and 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', the 'pleural effusion' is found in the 'Pleural' and 'Left Pleural', and the 'pneumonia' is found in the 'Pleural' and 'Right Pleural'. 

The A3 information provides the specific locations ['begin': 4, 'end': 4], ['begin': 7, 'end': 11] of the diseases in the patient's body which aligns with the locations given in A2.

Causal Exploration:
'Cardiomegaly' is typically caused by high blood pressure or coronary artery disease. These conditions cause the heart to work harder, leading to its enlargement. 

'Pleural effusion' can be caused by a variety of conditions such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, or a pulmonary embolism. It occurs when excess fluid builds up in the pleural space, the area between the lungs and the chest wall.

'Pneumonia' is usually caused by bacterial or viral infections in the lungs. The body sends white blood cells to attack the infection, which leads to inflammation and fluid build-up in the alveoli.

The findings A1-A4, therefore, could be explained by the presence of these conditions. The symptoms and the locations of these conditions as found in A1-A4 are consistent with the known medical understanding of these diseases. 

Therefore, the causal explanation for the findings in A1-A4 relevant to A5 could be that the presence of high blood pressure or coronary artery disease has led to 'cardiomegaly', bacterial or viral infections have caused 'pneumonia', and these or other conditions such as a pulmonary embolism have resulted in 'pleural effusion'.
