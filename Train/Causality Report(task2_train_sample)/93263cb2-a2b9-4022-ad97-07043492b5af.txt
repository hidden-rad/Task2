Causal Exploration:
'Cardiomegaly' is typically caused by high blood pressure or coronary artery disease. These conditions cause the heart to work harder, leading to its enlargement. 

'Pleural effusion' can be caused by a variety of conditions such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, or a pulmonary embolism. It occurs when excess fluid builds up in the pleural space, the area between the lungs and the chest wall.

'Pneumonia' is usually caused by bacterial or viral infections in the lungs. The body sends white blood cells to attack the infection, which leads to inflammation and fluid build-up in the alveoli.

The findings A1-A4, therefore, could be explained by the presence of these conditions. The symptoms and the locations of these conditions as found in A1-A4 are consistent with the known medical understanding of these diseases. 

Therefore, the Causal Exploration for the findings in A1-A4 relevant to A5 could be that the presence of high blood pressure or coronary artery disease has led to 'cardiomegaly', bacterial or viral infections have caused 'pneumonia', and these or other conditions such as a pulmonary embolism have resulted in 'pleural effusion'.
