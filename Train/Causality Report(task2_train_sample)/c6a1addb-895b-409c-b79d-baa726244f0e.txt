Causal Exploration: The pneumonia found in the parenchyme of various lobes of the lungs may have caused the observed asymmetry and abnormally increased density area in the lungs. This infection may have also led to the pleural effusion found in the pleural and right pleural areas, which could explain the blunted costophrenic angle and absence of free gas under the diaphragms. These conditions and their corresponding symptoms and signs can lead to serious health complications if not treated promptly and properly.
