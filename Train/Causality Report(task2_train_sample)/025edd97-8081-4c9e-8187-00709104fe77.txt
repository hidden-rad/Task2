Causal Exploration: The presence of atelectasis is likely to have resulted in a noticeable difference in lung volume. This condition, located in the 'Parenchyme', 'LLL (Left Lower Lobe)', and 'LUL (Left Upper Lobe)', with the provided location information, could have caused one lung to be significantly larger than the other. This is due to the fact that, in atelectasis, the impacted lobe of the lung collapses, making it appear smaller in size and volume compared to the unaffected lung or lobe. Consequently, the overall volume of the lungs might appear asymmetrical.
