For the part relevant to the observations, we find both 'pleural effusion' and 'edema' mentioned in the detailed observations. Therefore, we can add a causal statement to relate these findings.

For 'pleural effusion', the causal exploration could be: "The observation of 'costophrenic angle is blunting' could be indicative of a 'pleural effusion' as noted in the findings. This is because blunting of the costophrenic angle is a common sign of fluid accumulation in the pleural space, often seen in conditions causing pleural effusion. The location information from the observations suggests the pleural effusion is likely located in the right pleural, which aligns with the findings."

For 'edema', the causal exploration could be: "The observation of 'no abnormally increased density area' seems to contradict the finding of 'edema'. However, it's possible that the edema is not severe enough to cause noticeable changes in lung density. The location information from the observations does not specify where the edema is located, which fits with the nature of edema as it can occur throughout the lung parenchyma. This also aligns with the findings."

This way, we can relate these findings to provide a causal explanation of the observations.
