Causal Exploration: The discovery of 'pleural effusion' situated at various locations such as 'Pleural', 'Left Pleural', and an unspecified area, with specific location details, may account for the observed blunting of the costophrenic angle. Pleural effusion, defined as an unusual build-up of fluid in the pleural space, can cause the costophrenic angle to appear blunt on a radiograph. This is a frequent sign that radiologists use to diagnose pleural effusion.
