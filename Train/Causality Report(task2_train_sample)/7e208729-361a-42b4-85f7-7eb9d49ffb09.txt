From A4, both 'pleural effusion' and 'congestion' are relevant to A5. 

'Pleural effusion' is a condition in which excess fluid builds up in the pleural space, the area between the lungs and the chest wall. This can cause symptoms such as coughing, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. In the context of the statements in A5, the presence of pleural effusion could potentially cause the observed blunting of the costophrenic angle and the lack of clarity in seeing the left and right heart borders.

'Congestion', on the other hand, refers to the accumulation of excess fluid and can occur in various parts of the body. In the context of the lungs, congestion can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. From the statements in A5, congestion could potentially be the cause of the observed lack of symmetry in the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones of the lungs.

Causal Exploration: The findings of 'pleural effusion' and 'congestion', as identified in A1, are likely the cause of the observed abnormalities in the lungs as described in A5. The location of these findings, as specified in A2 and A3, further supports this explanation. The pleural effusion could be causing the blunting of the costophrenic angle and the lack of clarity in seeing the left and right heart borders. Similarly, the congestion could be causing the lack of symmetry in the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones of the lungs.
