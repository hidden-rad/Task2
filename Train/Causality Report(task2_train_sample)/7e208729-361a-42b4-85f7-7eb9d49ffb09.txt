Causal Exploration: The findings of 'pleural effusion' and 'congestion', as identified in A1, are likely the cause of the observed abnormalities in the lungs as described in A5. The location of these findings, as specified in A2 and A3, further supports this explanation. The pleural effusion could be causing the blunting of the costophrenic angle and the lack of clarity in seeing the left and right heart borders. Similarly, the congestion could be causing the lack of symmetry in the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones of the lungs.
