Causal Exploration: The presence of atelectasis (A1) was identified in the 'Parenchyme' and 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)' (A2) of the lung. The location information (A3) suggests that the affected areas start from the 9th to the 12th segment of the lung. This condition could be due to various factors including inhalation of foreign bodies, asymmetrical lung zones, abnormal increase in density area, or other abnormalities that were observed (A5). This could lead to a decrease in lung volume, causing one lung to not be prominently larger than the other, or to the blunting of the costophrenic angle. Further investigations are needed to ascertain the exact cause.
