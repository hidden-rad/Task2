The process of linking A4 to A5 involves recognizing relevant terms in the given text of A5 that correspond to the word 'hemothorax' in A4. 

In the provided text of A5, the sentence "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting." is related to 'hemothorax'. Hemothorax involves bleeding in the pleural cavity, which can result in the blunting of costophrenic angles due to fluid accumulation. 

Now, let's link this information with A1, the finding of a [fracture hemothorax], and the location information given in A2 and A3. 

Causal Exploration: A hemothorax, as mentioned in A4, is a condition where blood collects in the space between the chest wall and the lung (the pleural cavity). This was discovered in the finding A1, and can be caused by a chest injury, in this case, a fracture, as indicated in A2's location data. The blunt costophrenic angle noted in A5 can be a result of this hemothorax, as the buildup of blood can cause this appearance. The location information in A2 and A3, like 'Right Pleural' and 'Rib', further support the diagnosis of a hemothorax resulting from a fracture.
