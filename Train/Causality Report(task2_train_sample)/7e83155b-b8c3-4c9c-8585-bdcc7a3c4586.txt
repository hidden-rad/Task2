Causal Exploration: A hemothorax is a condition where blood collects in the space between the chest wall and the lung (the pleural cavity). This was discovered in the findings, and can be caused by a chest injury, in this case, a fracture. The blunt costophrenic angle can be a result of this hemothorax, as the buildup of blood can cause this appearance. The location information, like 'Right Pleural' and 'Rib', further support the diagnosis of a hemothorax resulting from a fracture.
