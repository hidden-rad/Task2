Causal Exploration: The terms 'atelectasis', 'mass', and 'metastasis' are pertinent to the medical conditions under discussion. These words denote the findings in a radiological examination of the lung parenchyma and lobes. The location of these findings is specified in the corresponding reports.

'Atelectasis' denotes a condition where a portion of the lung becomes airless and collapses. This could be due to a blockage of the air passages or pressure on the outside of the lung. Such a condition can be identified in a radiological examination as an area of abnormally increased density, as mentioned in the related descriptions.

A 'mass' in the lung could indicate a benign or malignant tumor. It can cause symptoms such as chest pain, coughing, and shortness of breath. In the related descriptions, this could be associated with the condition where the bronchial has not narrowed or cut off, and no inhaled foreign body such as batteries, nails, coins, etc. is seen.

'Metastasis' refers to the spread of cancer cells from their original location to another part of the body. In advanced stages, this can significantly affect the lungs, causing various abnormalities that can be detected in a radiological examination. In the related descriptions, this could be associated with conditions where one lung is not prominently larger than the other, and the lung vessels branch out progressively and uniformly.

These Causal Explorations provide an understanding of how these findings are interconnected and how they contribute to the overall diagnosis and condition of the patient.
