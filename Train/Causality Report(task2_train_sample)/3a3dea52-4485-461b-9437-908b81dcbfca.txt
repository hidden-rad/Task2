Causal Exploration: The discovery of cardiomegaly and pleural effusion, along with their specific locations, can be causally explained by certain statements. The heart enlargement, evident from the cardiothoracic ratio, could be a result of high blood pressure or coronary artery disease. This enlargement could lead to heart failure, which in turn could cause the pleural effusion, evident from the abnormal fluid buildup in the pleural space. Therefore, these findings are not isolated, but are interconnected, with possible causal relationships linking them.
