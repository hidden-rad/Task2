Causal Exploration: The detection of atelectasis was made in the 'Parenchyme' and 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)' of the lung. The location details suggest that the impacted areas span from the 9th to the 12th segment of the lung. This condition could be attributed to a variety of factors such as the inhalation of foreign bodies, asymmetrical lung zones, an unusual increase in density area, or other observed abnormalities. This might result in a reduction in lung volume, leading to one lung not being noticeably larger than the other, or to the blunting of the costophrenic angle. Further investigations are required to determine the precise cause.
