Causal Exploration: The presence of 'cardiomegaly' and 'pleural effusion' can be caused by various factors. The cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 and not in the normal range, suggesting an enlarged heart, or 'cardiomegaly'. This can be caused by conditions such as high blood pressure or coronary artery disease. Furthermore, the costophrenic angle is not blunted, which could indicate the presence of 'pleural effusion'. This can occur due to conditions such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, or lung cancer. Therefore, these findings are causally related as they provide potential explanations for the observed abnormalities.

This causal statement connects the findings by providing a Causal Exploration for the observed abnormalities.
