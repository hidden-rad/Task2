Causal Exploration:

The part in A4 relevant to A5 is 'cardiomegaly'. In the context of the findings A1~4, 'cardiomegaly' is a medical condition characterized by an enlarged heart. This condition was identified (A1) in the location information of the 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Ventricle' (A2) and with the specific location details provided (A3). 

The causal explanation for this could be that the enlarged heart (cardiomegaly) may have resulted due to various underlying conditions such as heart valve problems, high blood pressure, or other heart diseases. This condition can also lead to further complications such as heart failure if not treated in time.

The detailed examination (A5) reveals several aspects of the patient's lung and heart health, most notably the statement, "When assess cardiac size, cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 and not in the normal range." This indicates an abnormal enlargement of the heart, consistent with the diagnosis of cardiomegaly. 

Therefore, the findings A1~4 and the detailed examination (A5) all point towards the diagnosis of cardiomegaly, highlighting the importance of timely medical intervention to manage the condition and prevent further complications.
