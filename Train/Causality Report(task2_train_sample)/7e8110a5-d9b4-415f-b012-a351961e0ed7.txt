Causal Exploration: 

The unusual increase in lung density, observed in both the right and left lower lobes of the lung tissue, corresponds with the diagnosis of 'pneumonia' in the patient. This can be linked to the inflammation and consolidation of the lung tissue that is commonly associated with pneumonia. The specific location of these changes in the lung tissue, situated between certain positions, further supports the diagnosis. The symptoms described in the provided statements indirectly back up this diagnosis, even though 'pneumonia' is not explicitly mentioned.
