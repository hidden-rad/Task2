From A4, we have the terms 'pleural effusion' and 'pneumothorax'. 

In A5, we see that both of these terms are associated with a set of statements describing various assessments and observations during a medical examination. 

For 'pleural effusion', we note statements such as "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting." This suggests possible fluid accumulation in the lungs, which is a symptom of pleural effusion. 

For 'pneumothorax', we note the statement "When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other." This could suggest an abnormal expansion of the lungs, potentially due to trapped air, a symptom of pneumothorax. 

Adding a causal explanation, we can say:

Causal Exploration: The observation of a blunting costophrenic angle in A1-A4 could be due to fluid accumulation in the lungs, a symptom of pleural effusion. Similarly, if one lung is not prominently larger than the other, it could indicate the presence of trapped air, a symptom of pneumothorax. Therefore, the findings of pleural effusion and pneumothorax in A1-A4 could be causally explained by these observations.
