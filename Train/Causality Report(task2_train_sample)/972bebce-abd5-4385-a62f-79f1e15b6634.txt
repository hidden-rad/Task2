Causal Exploration: The observation of a blunting costophrenic angle in A1-A4 could be due to fluid accumulation in the lungs, a symptom of pleural effusion. Similarly, if one lung is not prominently larger than the other, it could indicate the presence of trapped air, a symptom of pneumothorax. Therefore, the findings of pleural effusion and pneumothorax in A1-A4 could be causally explained by these observations.
