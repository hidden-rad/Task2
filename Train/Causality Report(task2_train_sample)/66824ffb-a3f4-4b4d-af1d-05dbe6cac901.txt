In A4, the words ['cardiomegaly', 'pneumonia', 'granuloma'] are medical terms referring to specific conditions. 'Cardiomegaly' refers to an enlarged heart, 'pneumonia' refers to an inflammation of the lungs, and 'granuloma' is a small area of inflammation caused by tissue injury.

In A5, descriptions of various medical examinations are given for each of these conditions. For instance, for 'cardiomegaly', the description mentions observations such as 'cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 and not in the normal range', indicating an enlarged heart. Similarly, for 'pneumonia' and 'granuloma', descriptions of the examinations mention observations related to the lungs.

From the data provided in A1~4, we can see that the findings of 'cardiomegaly', 'pneumonia', and 'granuloma' were located in various parts of the body including the 'Parenchyme', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', 'RML(Right Middle Lobe)', and 'Mediastinum'.

Causal Exploration: The enlargement of the heart, or 'cardiomegaly', can be caused by high blood pressure or coronary artery disease. It can also be a response to stress from the body, such as from a valve malfunctioning or heart muscle damage. 

'Pneumonia' is typically caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal infections. The inflammation in the lungs can occur when the body tries to fight off the infection, resulting in the lungs filling with fluid.

'Granuloma' is typically caused by an immune response to foreign substances, including bacteria, fungi, or inhaled particles. The body forms a granuloma to prevent the substance from spreading, resulting in the small area of inflammation.

Therefore, the findings from A1~4 can be explained by these potential causes. The specific cause for these conditions would need further medical examination and testing to confirm.
