Causal Exploration: The existence of a mass and pleural effusion could be due to specific pathological processes. The mass might result in asymmetry in the lung volumes, causing one lung to appear larger than the other. Conversely, the pleural effusion could lead to a blunting of the costophrenic angle, as determined from the location information. The pleural effusion and mass are significant findings that could indicate underlying lung diseases.
