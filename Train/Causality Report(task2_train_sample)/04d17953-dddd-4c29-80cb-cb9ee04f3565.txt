Causal Exploration: The construction can be as follows:

Causal Exploration: The presence of pleural effusion and atelectasis can be related to observed abnormalities. The blunting of costophrenic angles suggests the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, a characteristic sign of pleural effusion. Moreover, the lack of prominent enlargement of one lung suggests the possibility of atelectasis, a condition where a part or the whole lung collapses. These findings provide a Causal Exploration for the observations made. Further diagnostic tests and assessments are needed to confirm these conditions and plan appropriate treatment strategies.
