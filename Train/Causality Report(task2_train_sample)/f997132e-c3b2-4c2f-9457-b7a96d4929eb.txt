Causal Exploration: The observed pleural effusion was found in the 'Right Pleural' area, with specific location details provided. This is in line with the description which noted 'costophrenic angle is blunting,' a common observation in cases of pleural effusion. The pleural effusion could be a result of various factors such as pneumonia, heart failure, or other lung conditions. 

In the same vein, the pneumothorax was also highlighted in the findings. The description mentions 'When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other,' which could suggest pneumothorax, where air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall. This could have occurred due to a blunt or penetrating chest injury, certain medical procedures, or damage from underlying lung disease.

It's crucial to remember that these are merely hypothetical Causal Explorations based on the provided information and actual medical diagnoses should always be made by a qualified healthcare provider.
