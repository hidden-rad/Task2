Cardiomegaly, alternatively, refers to a situation where the heart is enlarged. This could provide a rationale for observations like the 'cardiothoracic ratio exceeding 50' and the 'widened mediastinal width'. The location of these findings, such as the 'Mediastinum' and 'Middle Mediastinum (Heart)', further bolster this Causal Exploration.

In conclusion, these findings could be causally explained by the presence of 'atelectasis' and 'cardiomegaly', as suggested by the relevant observational statements.
