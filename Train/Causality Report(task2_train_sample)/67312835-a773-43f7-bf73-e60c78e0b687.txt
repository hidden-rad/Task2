Causal Explanation: The occurrence of conditions such as cardiomegaly, edema, and pleural effusion can be explained by detailed observations. These conditions are present in various parts of the body, indicating a widespread impact on the patient's health. Observations made about the trachea, bronchi, lungs, heart, and other parts of the body contribute to the diagnosis of these conditions. For instance, a cardiothoracic ratio being over 50 is a direct cause of cardiomegaly. Similarly, abnormal aspects observed in the lungs and heart contribute to the occurrence of edema and pleural effusion. Thus, these findings are causally linked and explained through these observations.
