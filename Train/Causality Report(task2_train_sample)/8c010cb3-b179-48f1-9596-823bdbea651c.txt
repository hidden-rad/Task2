Causal Exploration: 
The finding of 'atelectasis' in the 'Right Lower Lobe' (as indicated in A2 and A3) might be a result of airway obstruction which can be due to inhaled foreign bodies (as suggested by the QA5 statement "When trace down both main bronchi, no inhaled foreign body such as batteries, nails, coins, etc."). This could lead to a decrease in volume of the right lung, as highlighted in the QA5 statement "When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other."

Similarly, the finding of 'tumor' could be due to the abnormally increased density area found in the apical, upper, middle and lower zones of the lungs (as indicated in the QA5 statement "When compare the apical, upper, middle and lower zones in turn, there is an abnormally increased density area"). 

In conclusion, the findings of 'atelectasis' and 'tumor' are likely due to airway obstruction and abnormally increased density in the lungs, respectively. This Causal Exploration integrates the findings of A1~4 and the relevant parts of A5.
