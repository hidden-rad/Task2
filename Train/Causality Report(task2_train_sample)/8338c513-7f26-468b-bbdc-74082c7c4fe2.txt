Causal Exploration: The existence of this mass might suggest the possibility of cancer, as 'cancer' is another term found in the related context. The mass could be a tumor, a frequent symptom of lung cancer. The tumor has the potential to expand and reach other body parts, resulting in a range of health issues. It may lead to obstructions in the respiratory tracts, causing symptoms like coughing and breathlessness. The tumor also has the potential to infiltrate adjacent tissues and organs, leading to additional complications. The precise origin of the mass would need to be ascertained through further medical examinations.
