Causal Exploration:
1. Pleural Effusion: The presence of 'pleural effusion' might be causing the observed 'blunting of the costophrenic angle'. The fluid buildup in the pleural space can lead to changes in the angle between the diaphragm and the chest wall, typically observed as 'blunting' on a chest radiograph. This could explain the finding related to changes in the costophrenic angle.

2. Pneumonia: The condition of 'pneumonia' could be responsible for the 'abnormally increased density area' observed in the lungs. Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs, which may fill with fluid or pus, causing increased lung density. This can be a potential explanation for the findings related to lung density.

3. Edema: The 'edema', or swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in the body's tissues, might be causing the 'one lung appearing prominently larger than the other'. In particular, pulmonary edema involves fluid accumulation in the lungs, which can make them appear larger on a radiograph. This could account for the findings associated with lung size.

Each of these conditions has a unique set of symptoms and findings, and their presence could explain the observations documented. It is essential to correlate these findings with clinical symptoms and history for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.
