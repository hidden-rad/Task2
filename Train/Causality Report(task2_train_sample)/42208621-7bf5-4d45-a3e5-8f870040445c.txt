Causal Exploration: The blunting of the costophrenic angle, as noted in the examination, indicates the presence of fluid in the pleural space, leading to a pleural effusion. This finding is primarily located in the right pleural region. Furthermore, the observation that both lungs are not significantly different in volume suggests that there may be a collapse or closure of a part of the lung, indicative of atelectasis. This is particularly noted in the right middle lobe, right lower lobe, left upper lobe, and left lower lobe. Therefore, the examination findings of pleural effusion and atelectasis are causally related to the observed abnormalities in the lungs and pleural region."
