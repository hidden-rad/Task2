To tie together the findings and provide a causal explanation, we can look at the identified conditions ('pleural effusion' and 'edema') and their corresponding explanations. 

For 'pleural effusion', a detailed checklist of observations relating to the trachea, bronchi, lungs, hilum, lung vessels, diaphragm, cardiac borders, aortic arch and pulmonary trunk, mediastinum, ribs, and other bony structures is provided. None of these observations indicate the presence of pleural effusion, which suggests that the condition may have arisen due to factors not included in this checklist. 

Similarly for 'edema', the list of observations does not point to a clear cause. 

'Causal Exploration': Pleural effusion and edema are conditions that often result from other underlying health problems. Pleural effusion, the buildup of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs, can be caused by a variety of conditions such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, or lung cancer. Edema, on the other hand, is swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in the body's tissues, which can be the result of medications, pregnancy or more serious conditions such as heart failure or kidney disease. 

In this case, the findings do not provide a clear indication of the causes for these conditions. Further medical examination and tests might be necessary to determine the root causes. The location information can help doctors target these tests and examinations more effectively.
