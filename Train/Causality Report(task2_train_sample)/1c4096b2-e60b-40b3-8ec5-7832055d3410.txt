Based on the given information, it is difficult to directly link the two sets of data as they are different types. One refers to a list of words ['pleural effusion', 'atelectasis'], whereas the other is a list of tuples with each tuple containing a disease and a set of statements about various lung conditions. 

However, we can find a relation between the two on the basis of diseases. Both 'pleural effusion' and 'atelectasis' are mentioned in the latter set. 

In the context of pulmonary conditions, 'pleural effusion' refers to the build-up of fluid in the pleural space (between the lung and chest wall), and 'atelectasis' refers to the collapse or closure of a lung, which can result in reduced or absent gas exchange. 

From the latter set, we can see that these conditions are described in detail with a series of statements related to various aspects of lung conditions. These descriptions can be interpreted as potential causes or effects of 'pleural effusion' and 'atelectasis'.

For a 'Causal Exploration', we can say something like:

'Pleural effusion' and 'atelectasis', terms found in the first set, are present in the findings. The location information suggests that these conditions occur in the 'Pleural', 'Left Pleural', 'Right Pleural', and 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)'. 

For 'pleural effusion', the cause could be due to factors like heart failure, pneumonia, or liver disease. This may be indicated in the latter set by statements like "When trace the cardiac borders, the left and right heart borders are not clearly seen." or "When trace the hemidiaphragms in to the vertebra, right diaphragm is not higher than left." 

For 'atelectasis', it could be caused by conditions like a blocked airway or pressure from outside the lung. This can be seen in the latter set by statements like "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting." or "When trace down both main bronchi, the bronchial has not narrowed or cut off."

This causal explanation provides a possible link between the findings and the conditions 'pleural effusion' and 'atelectasis', with reference to the detailed descriptions.
