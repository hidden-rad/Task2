Causal Exploration: The finding of a 'pleural effusion', identified in the location information ['Pleural', 'Left Pleural', None] and [{'begin': 11, 'end': 12}], could be causally related to the observation of a blunting in the costophrenic angles. This is because pleural effusion, which involves the accumulation of excess fluid in the pleural space, often results in the blunting of costophrenic angles on radiographic imaging. Therefore, this specific observation could be causally explained by the presence of a pleural effusion.
