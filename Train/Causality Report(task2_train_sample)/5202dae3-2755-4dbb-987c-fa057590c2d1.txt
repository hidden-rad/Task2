The part in A4 ('pleural effusion') relevant to A5 is "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting.", as this could suggest the presence of a pleural effusion. 

Causal Exploration: The finding of a 'pleural effusion' (A1), identified in the location information ['Pleural', 'Left Pleural', None] (A2) and [{'begin': 11, 'end': 12}] (A3), could be causally related to the observation of a blunting in the costophrenic angles. This is because pleural effusion, which involves the accumulation of excess fluid in the pleural space, often results in the blunting of costophrenic angles on radiographic imaging. Therefore, this specific observation in A5 could be causally explained by the presence of a pleural effusion.
