In A4, we have two words: 'emphysema' and 'hemothorax'. These two words are also present in A5, as they were used to define the medical conditions being discussed in each of the statements. 

In A5, there are a number of statements that relate directly to the conditions in A4. For 'emphysema', the relevant statement is "When review the upper abdomen, soft tissues and take a look at some final check areas, there is a subcutaneous emphysema." This indicates that there is a presence of air or gas in the layer under the skin, a condition known as subcutaneous emphysema, which can be a complication of emphysema. 

Similarly, for 'hemothorax', while there isn't a direct mention in A5, we can infer from the detailed assessment of the lungs, bronchi, and other related structures that there is no evident abnormality or condition that could indicate a hemothorax. 

Causal Explanation:

In the findings from A1 to A4, we identified the presence of 'emphysema' and a potential 'hemothorax'. Upon further examination detailed in A5, we found evidence of subcutaneous emphysema. This could be a result of the emphysema identified in A4, where the damaging of lung tissues could lead to air escaping into the subcutaneous layer. 

For the 'hemothorax', the detailed assessments in A5 did not show any abnormalities that could indicate a hemothorax. This could mean that the potential hemothorax identified in A4 was not evident in the further examinations. 

In conclusion, the findings of 'emphysema' in A1~4 could have caused the subcutaneous emphysema identified in A5. However, the 'hemothorax' identified in A1~4 was not confirmed in the further assessments in A5.
