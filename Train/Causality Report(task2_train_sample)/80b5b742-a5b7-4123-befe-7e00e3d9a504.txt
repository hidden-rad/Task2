Causal Exploration: The atelectasis discovered in the parenchyme of the left lung lobes may be causing the observed size difference and increased density in the lung zones. This condition can reduce the lung's ability to inflate and deflate properly, affecting the oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange and potentially leading to hypoxia. The cause of the atelectasis should be identified and treated to prevent further lung damage and associated complications.
