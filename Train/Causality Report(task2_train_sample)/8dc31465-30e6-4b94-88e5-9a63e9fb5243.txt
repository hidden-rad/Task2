Causal Exploration: The detection of conditions such as 'pleural effusion' and 'pneumonia', pinpointed in the location information and their corresponding text spans, carry significant implications for the patient's health. 

In the instance of 'pleural effusion', there might be an impact on the normal lung expansion, as one lung may appear noticeably larger than the other. This could be attributed to the buildup of fluid in the pleural space, which leads to an enlargement of the chest cavity. Furthermore, the remark about the 'costophrenic angle blunting' can be associated with pleural effusion, as it is a typical radiographic indicator of the condition.

Regarding 'pneumonia', it could be the cause of the 'abnormally increased density area' observed in the lung zones. Pneumonia often manifests as an increased opacity on radiographs due to the consolidation and inflammation of the lung tissue.

Hence, the irregularities observed in the lung expansion and density could be a result of the detected conditions: 'pleural effusion' and 'pneumonia'. However, additional diagnostic tests are required to validate these findings.
