Causal Exploration: The observation of a blunting costophrenic angle could potentially be attributed to fluid accumulation in the lungs, a symptom of pleural effusion. Similarly, if one lung is not noticeably larger than the other, it could suggest the presence of trapped air, a symptom of pneumothorax. Therefore, the findings of pleural effusion and pneumothorax could be causally explained by these observations.
