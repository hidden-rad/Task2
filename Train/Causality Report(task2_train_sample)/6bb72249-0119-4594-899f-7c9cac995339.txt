Causal Exploration: The finding of a pleural effusion (A1) in our list of terms (A4) is not associated with a blunting of the costophrenic angles as per our observation (A5). This suggests that the pleural effusion may be located in areas other than the costophrenic angles, possibly in the 'Right Pleural' or 'Left Pleural' areas as indicated by the location information (A2). However, we currently lack further location information (A3) to confirm this.'
