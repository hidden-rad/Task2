Based on the given information, a part in A4 (pleural effusion) relevant to A5 could be the statement: ""When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is not blunted."", as a blunting of the costophrenic angle could indicate a pleural effusion.

The related causal statement may look like this:

'Causal Explanation: The finding of a pleural effusion (A1) in our list of terms (A4) is not associated with a blunting of the costophrenic angles as per our observation (A5). This suggests that the pleural effusion may be located in areas other than the costophrenic angles, possibly in the 'Right Pleural' or 'Left Pleural' areas as indicated by the location information (A2). However, we currently lack further location information (A3) to confirm this.'
