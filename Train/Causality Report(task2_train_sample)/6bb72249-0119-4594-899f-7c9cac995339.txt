Causal Exploration: The finding of a pleural effusion in our list of terms is not associated with a blunting of the costophrenic angles as per our observation. This suggests that the pleural effusion may be located in areas other than the costophrenic angles, possibly in the 'Right Pleural' or 'Left Pleural' areas as indicated by the location information. However, we currently lack further location information to confirm this.
