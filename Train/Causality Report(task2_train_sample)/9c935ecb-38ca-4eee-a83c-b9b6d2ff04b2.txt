The part in A4 relevant to A5 is 'pleural effusion'. The causal statement relating the findings of A1~4 could be:

Causal Exploration: The finding of Pleural Effusion (A1) in the locations 'Pleural', 'Right Pleural', and 'Left Pleural' (A2) with the specified location information (A3) can be attributed to the abnormalities identified in the QA5 assessment. Specifically, 'When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting.' This blunting could lead to an accumulation of fluid, resulting in a pleural effusion. The patient's clinical history and other diagnostic tests should be further evaluated to confirm this causal relationship and determine the appropriate treatment plan.
