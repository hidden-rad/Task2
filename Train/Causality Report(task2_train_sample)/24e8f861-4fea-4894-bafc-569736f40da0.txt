Causal Exploration: The presence of pleural effusion and atelectasis can lead to a series of anatomical changes and symptoms. The blunting of the costophrenic angle can be a result of pleural effusion as the excess fluid fills the space between the lung and the chest wall, altering the angle. Similarly, atelectasis can cause the tracheal diameter to narrow and affect lung expansion as the collapsed lung fails to fill with air. Detecting these changes can aid in the diagnosis of conditions like pleural effusion and atelectasis.

Location information and their respective positions further support these findings. For instance, if the pleural effusion or atelectasis is detected in the left upper lobe (LUL), it can explain the altered anatomical features in the same region. 

Therefore, the causative relationship between the abnormalities and the observed changes provides a comprehensive view of the patient's condition.
