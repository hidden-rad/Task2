The pleural effusion and atelectasis in A4 are directly related to the findings in A5 such as the blunting of the costophrenic angle, the narrowed tracheal diameter, and the abnormal lung expansion. These symptoms can be caused by a buildup of fluid in the pleural space (pleural effusion) or a collapse of the lung (atelectasis). 

Causal Explanation: The presence of pleural effusion and atelectasis can lead to a series of anatomical changes and symptoms identified in A5. The blunting of the costophrenic angle can be a result of pleural effusion as the excess fluid fills the space between the lung and the chest wall, altering the angle. Similarly, atelectasis can cause the tracheal diameter to narrow and affect lung expansion as the collapsed lung fails to fill with air. Detecting these changes can aid in the diagnosis of conditions like pleural effusion and atelectasis.

Location information (A2) and their respective positions (A3) further support these findings. For instance, if the pleural effusion or atelectasis is detected in the left upper lobe (LUL), it can explain the altered anatomical features in the same region. 

Therefore, the causative relationship between A1~4 and A5 is that the abnormalities found in A1~4 can lead to the observed changes in A5, providing a comprehensive view of the patient's condition.
