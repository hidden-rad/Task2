Causal Exploration: The presence of atelectasis may have led to a decrease in the size or expansion of one lung, as suggested by certain findings. Additional location information further confirms that the atelectasis is situated in the 'Parenchyme' and the 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)'. This could clarify the observed discrepancy in lung size and expansion. Therefore, the atelectasis could be the underlying reason for the abnormal lung size and expansion observed during the chest examination.
