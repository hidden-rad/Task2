The granuloma found in A1 is located in the 'Parenchyme', 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)', as per the location information given in A2 and A3. However, there is no specific text in the given QA5 relating to the granuloma in the 'Parenchyme', 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)'. 

'Causal Explanation': A granuloma is a small area of inflammation due to tissue injury or the presence of a foreign body such as bacteria or virus. The granuloma can cause abnormal increase in density in the lung area, as mentioned in the statement "When compare the apical, upper, middle and lower zones in turn, there is an abnormally increased density area.". This could potentially be the cause of the granuloma found in the 'Parenchyme', 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)'. Further investigations are needed to confirm the cause and prescribe appropriate treatment.
