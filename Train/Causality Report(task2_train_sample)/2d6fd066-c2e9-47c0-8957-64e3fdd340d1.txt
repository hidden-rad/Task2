The discoveries of 'pleural effusion' and 'cardiomegaly' were linked with specific location data and other findings. 

'Pleural effusion' is a condition characterized by an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, the area between the lung and the chest wall. This is evident from the location data which includes terms such as 'Pleural', 'Left Pleural', 'Right Pleural', and so on. The cause of this condition can be varied, including heart conditions like congestive heart failure, which could be related to the 'cardiomegaly' finding. 

'Cardiomegaly' is a term for an enlarged heart. This is evident from the location data which includes 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Atrium', 'Left Atrium', 'Right Ventricle', and 'Left Ventricle'. This condition can occur due to a variety of reasons including high blood pressure, heart valve disorders, etc. 

In the given context, the descriptions related to 'pleural effusion' and 'cardiomegaly' suggest that these conditions are currently present. For instance, statements like ""When trace the hemidiaphragms into the vertebra, the right diaphragm is not higher than the left."", ""When trace the cardiac borders, the left and right heart borders are not clearly seen."" indicate the presence of fluid in the pleural space and an enlarged heart respectively.

In conclusion, the findings of 'pleural effusion' and 'cardiomegaly', their relevant location information, and the corresponding descriptions, indicate that the patient may be suffering from heart-related conditions which are causing these symptoms.
