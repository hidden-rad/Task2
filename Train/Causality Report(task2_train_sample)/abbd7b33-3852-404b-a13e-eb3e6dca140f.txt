The part in A4 relevant to A5 is the mention of 'tuberculosis'. 

The findings of A1~4 indicate the presence of tuberculosis. This disease is known to affect the lungs and could potentially cause abnormalities in the lung parenchyme, specifically in the Right Upper Lobe (RUL) and Left Upper Lobe (LUL) as indicated in A2. The location information in A3, which shows a specific begin and end point, could represent the areas of the lungs where these abnormalities are found.

Causal Explanation: The presence of tuberculosis, as indicated in A4, could be the cause of the observed abnormalities in the parenchyme of the Right Upper Lobe (RUL) and Left Upper Lobe (LUL), as well as the specific location of these abnormalities as indicated in A1~3. This could potentially lead to changes in lung function and structure, which would be observable in the chest X-ray statements in A5. Further investigation and medical intervention may be necessary to manage the effects of this disease.
