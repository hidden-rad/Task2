Causal Exploration: The dulling of the costophrenic angle may be due to a pleural effusion, a condition that arises from the accumulation of surplus fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs. Likewise, the lack of an unusually dense area in the lungs might suggest the nonexistence of pneumonia, an infection that causes inflammation in the lung's air sacs. These conclusions are drawn from the location data provided.
