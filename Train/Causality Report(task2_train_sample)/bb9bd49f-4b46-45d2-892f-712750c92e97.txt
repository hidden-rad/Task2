Based on the given information, the term pneumonia is directly relevant to the statement "there is an abnormally increased density area". This abnormal increase in density in the lung areas can be a symptom or indicator of pneumonia. 

Therefore, the 'Causal Explanation' could be framed as:

'In the process of tracing down both lungs, an abnormal increase in density area was observed in the parenchyme of the RLL (Right Lower Lobe) and RUL (Right Upper Lobe). This abnormal density is a characteristic finding of pneumonia. Hence, the abnormal density potentially signals the presence of pneumonia.'
