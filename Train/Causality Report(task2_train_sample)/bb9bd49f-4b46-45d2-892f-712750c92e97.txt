Based on the given information, the term pneumonia from A4 is directly relevant to the statement "there is an abnormally increased density area" from A5. This abnormal increase in density in the lung areas can be a symptom or indicator of pneumonia. 

Therefore, the 'Causal Explanation' could be framed as:

'In the process of tracing down both lungs, an abnormal increase in density area was observed in the parenchyme of the RLL (Right Lower Lobe) and RUL (Right Upper Lobe) as located in A2 and specified in A3. This abnormal density is a characteristic finding of pneumonia as listed in A1 and directly corresponds to the term from A4. Hence, the abnormal density potentially signals the presence of pneumonia.'
