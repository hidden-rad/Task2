Atelectasis refers to the collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. It is often associated with various symptoms and conditions, including abnormal increase in density areas, asymmetry in lung zones, and prominent enlargement of one lung over the other.

From QA5, the relevant statements to Atelectasis (A4) could be: ""When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other.",", ""When compare the apical,upper,middle and lower zones in turn, it is asymmetrical.",", ""When compare the apical,upper,middle and lower zones in turn, there is an abnormally increased density area."

Causal Exploration: The presence of atelectasis (A1) was identified in the 'Parenchyme', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', 'Parenchyme', 'RML(Right Middle Lobe)', 'Parenchyme', 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)' (A2). The specific location of the finding spans from the 9th to the 11th position (A3). Atelectasis can cause one lung to appear prominently larger than the other and cause asymmetry in the comparison of the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones. Furthermore, it can also lead to an abnormally increased density area. These findings and their locations suggest a likely cause-effect relationship, wherein the identified atelectasis could be causing these observed abnormalities (A5).
