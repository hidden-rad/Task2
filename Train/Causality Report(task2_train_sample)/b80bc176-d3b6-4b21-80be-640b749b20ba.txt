Causal Exploration: The presence of atelectasis (A1) was identified in the 'Parenchyme', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', 'Parenchyme', 'RML(Right Middle Lobe)', 'Parenchyme', 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)' (A2). The specific location of the finding spans from the 9th to the 11th position (A3). Atelectasis can cause one lung to appear prominently larger than the other and cause asymmetry in the comparison of the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones. Furthermore, it can also lead to an abnormally increased density area. These findings and their locations suggest a likely cause-effect relationship, wherein the identified atelectasis could be causing these observed abnormalities (A5).
