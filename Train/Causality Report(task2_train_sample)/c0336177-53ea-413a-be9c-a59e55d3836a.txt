From the given information, we can identify the statement in A5 relevant to A4 ('pleural effusion') as:

"When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting."

This statement indicates an abnormal condition, which is often associated with pleural effusion. 

Now, let's put together all the findings of A1~4 and construct a causal explanation:

Causal Exploration:

The finding of a 'pleural effusion' (A1) was located in the 'Right Pleural' area (A2) within the characters 9 to 11 in the medical report (A3). This is causally linked to the observed condition where the 'costophrenic angle is blunting' (from A5). This blunting of the costophrenic angle is a common symptom observed in cases of 'pleural effusion' (A4), where excess fluid builds up in the pleural space causing the angle to appear blunter than normal. Therefore, the 'pleural effusion' is the probable cause for the observed blunting of the costophrenic angle.
