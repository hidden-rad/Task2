First, we need to identify the relevant part in A4, which are the words ['granuloma', 'atelectasis', 'cardiomegaly'], that matches with A5. From A5, we can see that all these terms are mentioned. Hence, these are the relevant parts in A4.

Now for the causal explanation, we need to connect the findings A1~A3 with these relevant parts. Here's the causal explanation:

"Causal Exploration: The findings of granuloma, atelectasis, and cardiomegaly identified as A1 are associated with the location information A2 which includes various parts of the lungs and heart. The specific locations where these conditions are found can provide critical insights into their causes and impacts on the patient's health. For instance, granulomas found in the parenchyme or lobes of the lungs may indicate an inflammatory response, while atelectasis in these areas could suggest a blockage or compression in the airways. Similarly, cardiomegaly identified in the atriums and ventricles of the heart may be a sign of conditions like heart disease or hypertension. The evidence A3 further supports these findings, providing a more detailed view of the affected areas. Thus, the correlation between these findings and the specific locations help in understanding the cause and effect of these conditions."
