Causal Exploration: The findings suggest the presence of atelectasis. The location information shows that the condition is present in the 'Parenchyme', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', and 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)'. This is consistent with the observations where the lungs are not fully expanded and the lung vessels are branching out normally. It is likely that the collapsed alveoli in these regions of the lungs are causing the observed decrease in lung volume. Therefore, the Causal Exploration for these findings is the presence of atelectasis in the lower lobes of the lungs.
