Causal Exploration: The discovery of a 'granuloma' in the 'Parenchyme' and 'Left Lower Lobe' at a specific location can be clarified by the observations made during a CT scan. The granuloma is an abnormality that could lead to an increased density area in the lung zones, and it might also influence the appearance of the hilar vessels and lung vessels. However, it doesn't necessarily impact the tracheal deviation, bronchial diameter, lung volume, cardiac position or size, aortic arch and pulmonary trunk position or size, mediastinal width, rib or other bony structures, or the upper abdomen. Therefore, the existence of a granuloma should always be verified through a comprehensive examination and not just based on these observations.
