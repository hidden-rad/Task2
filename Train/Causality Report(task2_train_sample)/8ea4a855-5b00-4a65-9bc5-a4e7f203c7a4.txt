Causal Exploration: The appearance of blunted costophrenic angles is a common indicator of pleural effusion. 

In the case of 'pneumonia', a possible Causal Exploration could be linked to the observation "Upon comparison of the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones, there is no area of abnormally increased density.". This could imply that the presence of an area with abnormally increased density, which is absent in this instance, is frequently a symptom of pneumonia.

Regarding 'cardiomegaly', the observation "Upon assessing cardiac size, the cardiothoracic ratio does not surpass 50 and falls within the normal range." could act as a Causal Exploration. In instances of cardiomegaly, the cardiothoracic ratio often goes beyond 50, signaling an enlarged heart.

Therefore, the 'Causal Exploration' for these conditions would be: 

The blunting of costophrenic angles seen in the chest x-ray might be the cause of the pleural effusion. The lack of an area with abnormally increased density could suggest an absence of infection or inflammation in the lungs, thereby excluding pneumonia. The normal cardiothoracic ratio might indicate that there is no heart enlargement, and therefore, no cardiomegaly. These findings are consistent with the location information provided earlier.
