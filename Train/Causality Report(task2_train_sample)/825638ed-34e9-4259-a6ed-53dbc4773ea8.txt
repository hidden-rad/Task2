"Causal Exploration: The detection of pleural effusion can lead to pressure on the lung, resulting in a contraction of its size, which could potentially cause atelectasis. This condition was identified in the right middle lobe of the lung parenchyme, as indicated by the location information. This is consistent with the observation in the chest radiograph where one lung appears not as prominently large as the other. Therefore, the pleural effusion could be the underlying cause of the observed atelectasis."
