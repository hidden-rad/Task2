Causal Exploration: The discoveries of 'pleural effusion' and 'congestion' are likely the reason for the observed abnormalities in the lungs. The location of these findings further supports this explanation. The pleural effusion could be causing the blunting of the costophrenic angle and the lack of clarity in seeing the left and right heart borders. Similarly, the congestion could be causing the lack of symmetry in the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones of the lungs.
