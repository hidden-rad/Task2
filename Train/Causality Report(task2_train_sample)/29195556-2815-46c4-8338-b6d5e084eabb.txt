Given the information in A1~4, the relevant part in A4 to A5 is the presence of 'pleurisy' and 'pneumonia'. These words are medical conditions that relate to lung diseases. 

In the context of A5, both 'pleurisy' and 'pneumonia' are mentioned. Pleurisy refers to the inflammation of the pleura, which is the membrane that lines the chest cavity and surrounds the lungs. Pneumonia, on the other hand, is a lung infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs.

According to the location information provided in A2 and A3, the finding of 'parenchyme', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', 'pleural', 'right pleural', and 'left pleural' suggest the presence of these conditions. Parenchyma is the functional tissue in an organ, in this case, the lungs. The right lower lobe is a specific part of the lungs, and the term 'pleural' refers to the pleura.

Causal Explanation: 
The conditions of 'pleurisy' and 'pneumonia' mentioned in A5 are likely the cause of the findings in A1~4. The presence of these conditions in the parenchyme and right lower lobe, as well as in the pleural areas of both lungs, as indicated in A2 and A3, can explain the abnormal observations. These may include inflammation, infection, or other abnormalities in these areas. Further medical examination and tests would be necessary to confirm this causal relationship and to determine the appropriate treatment.
