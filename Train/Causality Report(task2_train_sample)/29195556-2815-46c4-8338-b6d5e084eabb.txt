Causal Exploration: 
The conditions of 'pleurisy' and 'pneumonia' are likely the cause of the findings. The presence of these conditions in the parenchyme and right lower lobe, as well as in the pleural areas of both lungs, can explain the abnormal observations. These may include inflammation, infection, or other abnormalities in these areas. Further medical examination and tests would be necessary to confirm this causal relationship and to determine the appropriate treatment.
