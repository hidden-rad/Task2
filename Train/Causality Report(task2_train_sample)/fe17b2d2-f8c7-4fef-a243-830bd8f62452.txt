Causal Exploration: 

The findings of pleural effusion and metastasis were identified in the imaging of the patient's lungs. The location information revealed that these conditions were present in various parts of the lungs, including the 'Parenchyme', 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)', 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)', and 'Left Pleural'. The specific coordinates of these findings further verified their presence and location.

The conditions of pleural effusion and metastasis can cause various symptoms and complications, which are reflected in the detailed descriptions. For instance, the pleural effusion could be causing the blunting of the costophrenic angle, while the metastasis could be causing the abnormally increased density area in the lungs. 

This Causal Exploration thus links together the findings, illustrating how the identified conditions of pleural effusion and metastasis could be causing the observed symptoms and anomalies in the patient's lungs.
