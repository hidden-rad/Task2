Based on the given information, the part of A4 relevant to A5 would be the words 'pleural effusion' and 'metastasis'. These words represent medical conditions that could have been identified in the medical imaging referred to in A5.

A causal explanation that links together A1~A4 might look like this:

Causal Explanation: 

The findings of pleural effusion and metastasis (A1) were identified in the imaging of the patient's lungs. The location information (A2) revealed that these conditions were present in various parts of the lungs, including the 'Parenchyme', 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)', 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)', and 'Left Pleural'. The specific coordinates of these findings, given by A3, further verified their presence and location.

The conditions of pleural effusion and metastasis can cause various symptoms and complications, which are reflected in the detailed descriptions given in A5. For instance, the pleural effusion could be causing the blunting of the costophrenic angle, while the metastasis could be causing the abnormally increased density area in the lungs. 

This causal explanation thus links together the findings of A1~A4, illustrating how the identified conditions of pleural effusion and metastasis could be causing the observed symptoms and anomalies in the patient's lungs.
