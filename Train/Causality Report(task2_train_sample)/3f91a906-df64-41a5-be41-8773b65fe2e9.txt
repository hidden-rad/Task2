"Causal Exploration: The discovery of 'pleural effusion' in areas such as the 'Parenchyme', 'Right Upper Lobe', 'Right Middle Lobe', 'Pleural', and 'Right Pleural', along with the noted report segments, indicates the existence of fluid in the pleural space. This is further supported by the report's mention of blunting of the costophrenic angles. The build-up of fluid, known as pleural effusion, can be attributed to a variety of factors including infection, inflammation, or malignancy, among others. This may lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath and chest pain, necessitating additional medical examination and treatment."
