Causal Exploration: The abnormally increased density area found in the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones of the lung is a common symptom of pneumonia. This is because pneumonia often leads to the inflammation of the air sacs in the lungs, which can fill with fluid or pus, causing the mentioned increased density. The pneumonia is located in the 'Parenchyme' and 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)'. The location specifics are found between the 7th and 9th area. Therefore, the findings are causally related to the description of the increased density. This is the causal exploration of the part relevant to the increased density.
