Causal Exploration:

1. 'mass': The presence of a mass was detected. This is an abnormal increase in density area which may be due to a variety of reasons including tumors, infection, or inflammation. Its location can be determined based on A2 and A3. Additional tests like biopsy may be needed to identify the exact nature of the mass. 

2. 'cardiomegaly': Cardiomegaly, or an enlarged heart, was found. This could be due to various reasons such as high blood pressure, heart valve disease, or heart failure. The location of the heart, its size, and the state of the cardiac borders found in A2 and A3 can help in determining the severity and cause of the cardiomegaly. 

3. 'pleural effusion': Pleural effusion, which is fluid buildup between the layers of the lung's protective covering (pleura), was detected. This can be caused by a number of conditions including pneumonia, liver disease, or heart failure. The location of the effusion can be determined based on A2 and A3, and other tests may be needed to identify the cause. 

4. 'pneumonia': Pneumonia was found, which is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The bacteria or virus causing the pneumonia can cause the air sacs to fill with fluid or pus, leading to symptoms like cough with phlegm, fever, and difficulty breathing. The location and extent of the pneumonia can be seen in A2 and A3.

These findings can be used to guide further diagnostics and treatment.
