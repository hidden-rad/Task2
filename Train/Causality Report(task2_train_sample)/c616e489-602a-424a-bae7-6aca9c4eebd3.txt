The relevant parts in A4 to A5 are 'atelectasis', 'pleural effusion', and 'cardiomegaly'. We can see that these terms are present in the findings A1 and the statements in A5.

Causal Exploration:

1. Atelectasis: This condition refers to the collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. In the context of the statements in A5, this could be caused by "When trace down the trachea to the carina, the tracheal diameter has not narrowed or widened." and "When compare the apical, upper, middle and lower zones in turn, there is an abnormally increased density area." The fact that these conditions exist are confirmed by the location information in A2 and A3.

2. Pleural Effusion: This refers to the build-up of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs. In the context of the statements in A5, this could be caused by "When trace the hemidiaphragms in to the vertebra, right diaphragm is not higher than left." and "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is not blunted." The fact that these conditions exist are confirmed by the location information in A2 and A3.

3. Cardiomegaly: This is a condition which causes the heart to enlarge. In the context of the statements in A5, this could be caused by "When assess cardiac size, cardiothoracic ratio does not exceed 50 and is in the normal range." and "When check the cardiac position, the heart position is not located on 1/3 the right side and 2/3 on the left side." The fact that these conditions exist are confirmed by the location information in A2 and A3.

In conclusion, the parts in A4 are relevant to A5 because they provide a causal explanation for the findings in A1, confirmed by the location information in A2 and A3.
