The relevant part in A4 ('pneumothorax') to A5 is the statement "When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other." Pneumothorax is a condition where air gets into the space between the lung and the chest wall, causing the lung to collapse and resulting in one lung appearing larger than the other on imaging studies.

Causal Explanation:
The finding of 'pneumothorax' (A1) located within the 'Parenchyme' and 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)' (A2), and the specific location information of {'begin': 1, 'end': 3} (A3) can be causally related to the statement in A5. In the case of a pneumothorax, air escapes from the lung and fills the space outside of the lung, between the lung and chest wall. This can cause the lung to collapse, making one lung appear prominently larger than the other, as stated in A5. This abnormality would be identified during the review of the chest imaging, which is consistent with the findings in A1~4. Therefore, the pneumothorax is the cause of the observed asymmetry in lung volume.
