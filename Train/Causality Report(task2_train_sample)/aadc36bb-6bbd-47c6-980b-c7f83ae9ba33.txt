Causal Exploration: The occurrence of pleural effusion and edema can be directly linked to certain findings. Pleural effusion causes blunting of the costophrenic angles due to fluid accumulation in the pleural space, and edema can cause one lung to appear larger than the other due to fluid retention in the lung tissue. These findings correlate with the location information, providing a comprehensive Causal Exploration for the observed conditions.
