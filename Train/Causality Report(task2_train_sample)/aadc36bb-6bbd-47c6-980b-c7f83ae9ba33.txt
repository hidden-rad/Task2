In A4, both 'pleural effusion' and 'edema' are relevant to the findings in A5. 

Pleural effusion refers to the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, which is the cavity between the lungs and the chest wall. In A5, the finding "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting." is indicative of a pleural effusion. The blunting of the costophrenic angle is a common sign of pleural effusion, as the excess fluid fills this space and obscures the sharp angle normally seen on imaging.

Edema, or swelling caused by fluid retention, could be related to the finding in A5 that states "When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other." If there is pulmonary edema, or fluid accumulation in the lung tissue, it can cause the affected lung to appear larger than the other.

Causal Exploration: The occurrence of pleural effusion and edema as found in A1 and A2, can be directly linked to the findings in A5. Pleural effusion causes blunting of the costophrenic angles due to fluid accumulation in the pleural space, and edema can cause one lung to appear larger than the other due to fluid retention in the lung tissue. These findings correlate with the location information in A3, providing a comprehensive causal explanation for the observed conditions.
