Causal Exploration: The occurrence of pleural effusion and edema as found in A1 and A2, can be directly linked to the findings in A5. Pleural effusion causes blunting of the costophrenic angles due to fluid accumulation in the pleural space, and edema can cause one lung to appear larger than the other due to fluid retention in the lung tissue. These findings correlate with the location information in A3, providing a comprehensive Causal Exploration for the observed conditions.
