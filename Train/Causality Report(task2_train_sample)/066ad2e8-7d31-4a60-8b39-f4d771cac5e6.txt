Causal Exploration: 

The detection of an enlarged heart, or cardiomegaly, could be attributed to a variety of factors such as high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, or heart valve disorders. This condition might potentially result in pleural effusion, as the heart's inability to pump blood effectively could lead to a fluid buildup in the lungs and pleura. This might be the reason for the detected pleural effusion.

Moreover, the pleural effusion could apply pressure on the lungs, causing a partial or complete lung collapse, also known as atelectasis. This might provide an explanation for the noted atelectasis.

Hence, it can be theorized that the cardiomegaly has resulted in pleural effusion, which subsequently caused atelectasis. This forms a potential Causal Exploration linking these observations. However, additional medical examinations and tests are necessary to validate this theory.
