Based on the given information, the relevant part in A4 to A5 is 'atelectasis'. 

Atelectasis is a condition in which the air sacs in the lungs are deflated, causing a lack of gas exchange. This condition can be caused by a blockage of the air passages or pressure on the outside of the lung. 

Therefore, the causal explanation could be: "Causal Exploration: The atelectasis identified in A1 may be due to abnormalities in the 'Parenchyme', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', and 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)' as described in A2. The location information of these findings, as outlined in A3, further supports this diagnosis. The atelectasis could have caused the abnormal increased density area mentioned in A5, causing a decrease in lung expansion and volume. This could lead to the observed symptoms and further complications if left untreated."
