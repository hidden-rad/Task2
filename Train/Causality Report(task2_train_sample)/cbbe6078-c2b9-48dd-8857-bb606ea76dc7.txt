The part in A4 relevant to A5 is the words 'mass' and 'pleural effusion'. 

In the finding of A1, 'mass pleural effusion' was detected. The location information of the finding (A2) shows that it is located in the 'Parenchyme', 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)', and 'Pleural', 'Left Pleural'. The exact position is documented in A3 with 'begin' at 7 and 'end' at 8. 

In A5, we have further detailed descriptions related to 'mass' and 'pleural effusion'. For example, it states ""When compare the apical,upper,middle and lower zones in turn, there is an abnormally increased density area."", which could be referring to the 'mass'. It also mentions ""When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is not blunted."", which could be indicative of 'pleural effusion'.

A causal explanation for the findings could be as follows:

Causal Exploration: The presence of a mass and pleural effusion in the left lower lobe and parenchyme, as indicated in A1~3, may be causing an abnormally increased density in the lung zones and no blunting of the costophrenic angle, as described in A5. These observations suggest that the mass and pleural effusion are impacting the structure and function of the lung, leading to the observed abnormalities. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause and potential treatments for these findings.
