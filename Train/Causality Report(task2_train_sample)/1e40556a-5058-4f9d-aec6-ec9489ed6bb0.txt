The part in A4 relevant to A5 is 'interstitial lung disease'. 

Causal Explanation: The findings of A1~4 indicate that the patient is suffering from Interstitial Lung Disease. This can be concluded from the location information of the finding provided by A2. The disease is found in the 'Parenchyme' of 'RML(Right Middle Lobe)', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)', 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)', and 'RUL(Right Upper Lobe)'. In addition, the location information given in A3 also supports this diagnosis. The statements in A5 describe the abnormalities that can be seen in the lungs due to this disease. This includes increased density in certain areas, abnormal hilum, and issues with the lung vessels. The disease may also cause the lung to not expand well and may lead to asymmetry in the different zones of the lungs. This causal exploration helps us understand the reasons behind these findings and their implications for the patient's health.
