From the provided information, we can see that the word 'metastasis' (A4) is related to an abnormality or change in the body that could potentially be seen in a variety of locations (A2) such as the Parenchyme or the lobes of the lungs.

The causal statement could be: 

'Causal Exploration: The detection of metastasis (A1) in various locations including the Parenchyme, Right Upper Lobe, Right Middle Lobe, Right Lower Lobe, Left Upper Lobe, and Left Lower Lobe (A2), which was identified in the range from the 2nd to 12th position (A3), may be causing changes or abnormalities in the lungs. These can include tracheal deviation, narrowing or widening of the bronchi, increased density in the lung zones, or abnormalities in the lung vessels and hilum (A5). This metastasis could potentially be responsible for these observed changes and may require further investigation and treatment.'
