In the list, there is only one word 'atelectasis'. Atelectasis is a condition where a part of the lung collapses or does not inflate properly. It can be caused by various factors such as blockage of the airways or pressure on the outside of the lung.

In the context of the findings, it can be said that the atelectasis, located in the 'Parenchyme', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)' and 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)', has caused an abnormally increased density area.

So, in terms of a 'Causal Explanation', it can be stated that the presence of atelectasis in the lower lobes of the lung, has resulted in an abnormally increased density area in the lung. This increased density could be due to the collapsed or improperly inflated lung tissue caused by atelectasis. Further medical investigation and treatment may be necessary to address this condition.
