In the list A4, there is only one word 'atelectasis'. Atelectasis is a condition where a part of the lung collapses or does not inflate properly. It can be caused by various factors such as blockage of the airways or pressure on the outside of the lung. 

In the context of the findings A1~4, it can be said that the atelectasis, located in the 'Parenchyme', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)' and 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)' as per A2 and A3, has caused an abnormally increased density area as mentioned in A5.

So, in terms of a 'Causal Explanation', it can be stated that the presence of atelectasis in the lower lobes of the lung as identified in A1~A3, has resulted in an abnormally increased density area in the lung, which is a significant finding mentioned in A5. This increased density could be due to the collapsed or improperly inflated lung tissue caused by atelectasis. Further medical investigation and treatment may be necessary to address this condition.
