'Causal Exploration: The discovery of pleural effusion, which was found in both the right and left pleural areas, may be attributed to the blunting of the costophrenic angle. This was noted when following the lateral edges of the lung to the costophrenic angles. This condition can lead to a buildup of fluid in the pleural space, resulting in the detected pleural effusion.'
