Causal Exploration: 
The finding of cardiomegaly was identified in the Mediastinum, specifically in the Middle Mediastinum (Heart) and Left Ventricle, as indicated by the location information. This condition is represented in the statement "When assessing cardiac size, the cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 and not in the normal range". Causal exploration reveals that cardiomegaly refers to an enlarged heart, which can be determined by an increased cardiothoracic ratio. This enlargement can be caused by high blood pressure or coronary artery disease, and it can result in shortness of breath, fainting, and other complications. In this context, the increased cardiothoracic ratio is a direct indicator of cardiomegaly.
