Causal Exploration: The detection of pleural effusion in the left pleural region, based on the provided location information, could be the reason behind the observed blunting of the costophrenic angle in the chest scan. The build-up of fluid can make the costophrenic angle, which is the angle between the rib cage and the diaphragm, appear less sharp or blunted. This is a typical indication of pleural effusion. Additional diagnostic procedures are advised to validate this observation and identify the root cause of the effural effusion.
