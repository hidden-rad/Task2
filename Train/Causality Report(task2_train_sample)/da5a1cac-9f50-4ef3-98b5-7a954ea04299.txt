Causal Exploration: The occurrence of 'congestion' identified in A1, is evidenced by the abnormal increase in density area found in the apical, upper, middle and lower zones of the lungs. This finding, denoted as A2, was located in the 'Parenchyme', 'RUL(Right Upper Lobe)', 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)', 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', and 'RML(Right Middle Lobe)', as recorded in A3. This suggests that the congestion is widespread, affecting multiple sections of the lungs."
