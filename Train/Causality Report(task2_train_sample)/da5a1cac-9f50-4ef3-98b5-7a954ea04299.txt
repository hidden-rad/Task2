The symbol A4 represents the word 'congestion'. In the context of A5, the statement "When compare the apical, upper, middle and lower zones in turn, there is an abnormally increased density area." seems to relate to 'congestion'. Congestion in medical terms often refers to an excessive or abnormal accumulation of blood or other fluids in a body part or blood vessel, which can lead to increased density in the affected area.

Therefore, the causal explanation relating the findings of A1~4 could be: 

"Causal Exploration: The occurrence of 'congestion' identified in A1, is evidenced by the abnormal increase in density area found in the apical, upper, middle and lower zones of the lungs. This finding, denoted as A2, was located in the 'Parenchyme', 'RUL(Right Upper Lobe)', 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)', 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', and 'RML(Right Middle Lobe)', as recorded in A3. This suggests that the congestion is widespread, affecting multiple sections of the lungs."
