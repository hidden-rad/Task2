We see that 'pneumothorax' and 'edema' are the relevant parts. 

In the case of 'pneumothorax', the causal statement could be: "The absence of tracheal deviation, an unchanged tracheal diameter, and the absence of inhaled foreign bodies such as batteries, nails, coins, etc., as well as the symmetrical comparison of the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones, could have resulted in a pneumothorax. This finding is located in the 'Parenchyme' and 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)' as per the given information." 

For 'edema', the causal statement could be: "The lack of tracheal deviation, unchanged tracheal diameter, and the absence of inhaled foreign bodies could have led to edema. Moreover, the symmetrical comparison of the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones could indicate the presence of edema. This finding is located in the 'Parenchyme' and 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)' as per the given information."

These are the causal explanations for the findings, adding the 'Causal Exploration' to the health condition.
