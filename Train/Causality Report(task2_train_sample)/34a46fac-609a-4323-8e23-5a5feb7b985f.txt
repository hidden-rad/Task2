From A4, we see that 'pneumothorax' and 'edema' are the relevant parts to A5. 

In the case of 'pneumothorax', the causal statement could be: "The absence of tracheal deviation, an unchanged tracheal diameter, and the absence of inhaled foreign bodies such as batteries, nails, coins, etc., as well as the symmetrical comparison of the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones, could have resulted in a pneumothorax. This finding is located in the 'Parenchyme' and 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)' as per the information from A2 and A3." 

For 'edema', the causal statement could be: "The lack of tracheal deviation, unchanged tracheal diameter, and the absence of inhaled foreign bodies could have led to edema. Moreover, the symmetrical comparison of the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones could indicate the presence of edema. This finding is located in the 'Parenchyme' and 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)' as per the information from A2 and A3."

These are the causal explanations for the findings A1~4, adding the 'Causal Exploration' to the health condition.
