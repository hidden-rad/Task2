The term "effusion" is pertinent to the assertion "When tracing the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, there is a blunting of the costophrenic angle." 

Effusion is a term used to describe the unusual accumulation of fluid in different body cavities. Specifically, within the thoracic region, it often denotes the accumulation of fluid between the layers of the pleura, which are the thin spaces that separate the lungs from the chest wall. 

This pleural effusion can result in the blunting or obscuring of the costophrenic angle, which is the angle formed between the rib cage and the diaphragm, when viewed on a chest radiograph. This happens because the fluid fills the space in the pleural cavity, pushing the lung upward, and thus affecting the clear visibility of the costophrenic angle.

Therefore, the causal explanation is as follows: The location details of the finding suggest that the effusion is present in both the left and right pleural cavities. This is causing the costophrenic angles to appear blunted, as the fluid accumulation is obscuring the clear delineation of these angles.
