Causal Exploration: Findings suggest links between conditions such as 'atelectasis,' 'pneumonia,' and 'pleural effusion' and symptoms like increased density or changes in costophrenic angles. For instance, atelectasis may be indicated by increased density in the Right Lower Lobe (RLL), reflecting lung collapse. Similarly, other report features point to pneumonia or pleural effusion in specified lung areas, highlighting potential causal relationships between symptoms and these conditions.
