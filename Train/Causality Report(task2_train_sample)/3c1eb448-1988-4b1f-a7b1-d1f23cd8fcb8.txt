To create a causal explanation of the findings A1~4, we need to relate the findings to the relevant parts in A4 mentioned in A5. 

A4 contains the list of words: ['atelectasis',  'pneumonia',  'pleural effusion']. Correspondingly, in QA5, we find that these three conditions relate to a wide range of symptoms and observations mentioned in the medical report. For example, features like "abnormally increased density area" or "costophrenic angle is not blunted" could potentially be symptoms of these conditions.

In order to generate a causal explanation, we first identify the corresponding parts in the report that might indicate the presence of these conditions. Based on the location information given in A2 and A3, we can then identify where these conditions are likely to occur in the lung.

Let's take 'atelectasis' as an example. Atelectasis is a condition that involves the collapse or closure of a lung, which results in reduced or absent gas exchange. It may be acute or chronic and it is usually unilateral, affecting part or all of one lung. According to the location information given, we can hypothetically say that the increased density area in the RLL(Right Lower Lobe) could be a result of atelectasis. 

Following this method, we can generate similar causal explanations for 'pneumonia' and 'pleural effusion', relating the symptoms mentioned in the report to these conditions and their probable locations in the lung.

Finally, we add the term 'Causal Exploration' to denote that this explanation is based on exploring potential causal relationships between the symptoms and the conditions.

Note: This is a hypothetical medical scenario and the causal explanation given here is a general illustration, actual medical diagnosis and explanations would need a detailed examination and expert medical judgement.
