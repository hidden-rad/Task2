Causal Exploration: The findings of pneumonia, located in the 'Parenchyme' and 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)' with the location information [{'begin': 7, 'end': 9}], could be the cause of the abnormally increased density area in the lung. This is because pneumonia often results in an inflammation of the alveoli in the lungs, which can fill with fluid or pus, leading to an area of increased density visible on a chest X-ray.
