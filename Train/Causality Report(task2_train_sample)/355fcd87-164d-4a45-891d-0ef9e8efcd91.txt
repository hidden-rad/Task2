Causal Exploration: The findings of 'pleural effusion' in the list can be linked to the observation stating "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting.". This is because pleural effusion, which is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space (as indicated by the location information), can lead to the blunting of costophrenic angles as the fluid occupies the space and changes the angle's appearance. This provides a Causal Exploration of the observed medical condition.
