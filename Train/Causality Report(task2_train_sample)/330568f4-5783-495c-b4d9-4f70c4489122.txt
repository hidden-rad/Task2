Causal Exploration: The occurrence of pleural effusion and edema, as identified in certain instances, can be directly linked to the findings in other related cases. Pleural effusion leads to blunting of the costophrenic angles due to fluid accumulation in the pleural space, and edema can cause one lung to appear larger than the other due to fluid retention in the lung tissue. These findings correlate with the location information in another case, providing a comprehensive Causal Exploration for the observed conditions.
