Causal Exploration: The identified atelectasis might be a result of abnormalities in the 'Parenchyme', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', and 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)'. The location information of these findings further supports this diagnosis. The atelectasis might have led to the abnormal increase in density area, resulting in a decrease in lung expansion and volume. If left untreated, this could lead to the observed symptoms and further complications.
