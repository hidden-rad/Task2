Causal Exploration: These findings, along with the presence of pleural effusion, congestion, and cardiomegaly from A4, suggest that the patient may have a heart condition that is causing these symptoms. The heart's inability to pump blood efficiently can lead to congestion and the build-up of fluid in the lungs, resulting in pleural effusion. The enlarged heart (cardiomegaly) could be a result of the heart's effort to compensate for its reduced pumping ability. This Causal Exploration aligns with the findings from A1 to A4.
