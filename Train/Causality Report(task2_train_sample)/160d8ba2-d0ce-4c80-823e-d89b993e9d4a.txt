The part which is 'nodule', is relevant to the statement: ""When compare the apical, upper, middle and lower zones in turn, there is an abnormally increased density area." Here, the term 'abnormally increased density area' could be referring to a nodule. 

'Causal Exploration': The finding, which is the detection of a 'nodule', is causally linked to the location information of the finding, i.e., 'Parenchyme', 'RUL(Right Upper Lobe)', and the given coordinates, i.e., [{'begin': 1, 'end': 2}]. This nodule was identified in the right upper lobe of the lung parenchyma. The causal relationship here is that the presence of the nodule in the right upper lobe of the lung parenchyma is causing an abnormally increased density area when comparing the apical, upper, middle and lower zones of the lungs.
