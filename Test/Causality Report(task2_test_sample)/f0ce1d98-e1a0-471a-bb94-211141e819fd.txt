The part in A4 relevant to A5 is cardiomegaly and pleural effusion. 

Cardiomegaly is a condition where the heart is enlarged which can be caused by high blood pressure or coronary artery disease. It is often a sign of another heart problem such as heart failure. The common symptoms include shortness of breath, irregular heartbeat, and swelling in the legs. In the case of cardiomegaly, the cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 which is not in the normal range as indicated in the A5 statement.

Pleural effusion, on the other hand, is a condition where there is a buildup of fluid in the pleural space, the area between the lungs and the chest wall. This can be caused by heart failure, pneumonia, liver disease, or kidney disease. Symptoms include chest pain, difficulty breathing, and cough. 

Causal Exploration: The findings of cardiomegaly and pleural effusion in A1, the location of these findings in A2, and the specific information in A3 can be causally explained by the statements in A5. The heart enlargement, evident from the cardiothoracic ratio in A5, could be a result of high blood pressure or coronary artery disease. This enlargement could lead to heart failure, which in turn could cause the pleural effusion, evident from the abnormal fluid buildup in the pleural space. Therefore, the findings in A1~4 are not isolated, but are interconnected, with possible causal relationships linking them.
