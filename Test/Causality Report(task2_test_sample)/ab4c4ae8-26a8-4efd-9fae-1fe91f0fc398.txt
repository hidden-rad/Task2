The part in A4 relevant to A5 is 'pleural effusion'. 

Causal Exploration: The finding of 'pleural effusion' (A1) in the location ['Pleural', 'Left Pleural', None] (A2) with the specific location information [{'begin': 8, 'end': 10}] (A3) can be caused by various conditions including pneumonia, heart failure, and lung cancer. The description from A5, "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting." indicates the presence of fluid in the pleural space, which is a common sign of pleural effusion. This suggests that the patient's 'pleural effusion' could be due to an underlying condition causing fluid build-up in the pleural space. Further tests are needed to confirm the cause and appropriate treatment for the patient's condition.
