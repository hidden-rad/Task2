Causal Exploration: 

The presence of 'pleural effusion' and 'atelectasis' can be explained by the changes noted. Specifically, the blunting of the costophrenic angle is a common sign of pleural effusion. This change in the costophrenic angle might be due to the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space (Parenchyme, {'begin': 2, 'end': 10}), and this process could be triggered by various causes like infection, inflammation, heart failure, or malignancy.

Similarly, the finding of atelectasis could be due to a lack of expansion in one lung as described. This could be due to an obstruction in the airway (RLL(Right Lower Lobe), {'begin': 2, 'end': 10}), leading to a collapse of the lung tissue. The causes of this obstruction could be a foreign body, mucus plug, or tumor.

Thus, the findings are causally linked to the descriptions, providing a Causal Exploration of these abnormalities.
