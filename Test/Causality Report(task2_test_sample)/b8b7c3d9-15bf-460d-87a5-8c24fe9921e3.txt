Causal Exploration: The discovery of 'pneumothorax' in the specified location, which includes 'Parenchyme', 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)', and an unspecified area, could lead to the observed irregularities in lung expansion and the costophrenic angle. This is due to the fact that a pneumothorax can cause a lung to collapse, making it appear less expanded and potentially changing the appearance of the costophrenic angles. This Causal Exploration aids in understanding how these findings are related to the described abnormalities.
