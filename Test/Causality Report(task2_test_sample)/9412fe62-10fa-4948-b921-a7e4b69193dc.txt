Causal Exploration:

- Cardiomegaly: This condition could be due to several factors such as high blood pressure, heart valve disease, or weakening of the heart muscle. In the context of A5, the cardiothoracic ratio being over 50 suggests an enlarged heart, leading to the diagnosis of cardiomegaly.

- Pneumonia: This is often caused by infections, most commonly bacteria and viruses. The finding of no abnormally increased density area in A5 might be contradicting this diagnosis. However, pneumonia could be in early stage or not severe enough to cause noticeable changes in the lung's image.

- Pleural Effusion: This condition often occurs when the body produces too much fluid or it can't remove it fast enough. In A5, the fact that the costophrenic angle is not blunted could suggest the presence of fluid in the pleural space, leading to pleural effusion. 

It's important to note that these explanations are based on the provided findings A1~4 and the statements in A5. Further diagnostic tests might be necessary to confirm these conditions.
