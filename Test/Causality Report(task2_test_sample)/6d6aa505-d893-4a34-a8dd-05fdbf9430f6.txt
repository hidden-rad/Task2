After examining the QA5, it seems there's no direct mention or allusion to 'pleural effusion', which is the term represented by A4. Therefore, it's not possible to find a part in A4 relevant to A5. 

However, if there were any mentions or implications of 'pleural effusion' in the QA5, a causal statement could look something like this: 

Causal Exploration: The findings of A1, indicating the presence of a [pleural effusion], can potentially be explained by abnormal results from the tests conducted in A5. The location of the finding, as specified in A2 and A3, suggests that the pleural effusion may be influencing the conditions listed in A5, causing them to deviate from their normal state. Further investigation is required to confirm this.

Please note that this statement is hypothetical and assumes there was mention of conditions in A5 that can be caused by a pleural effusion.
