Since the document includes the terms 'pleural effusion' and 'atelectasis', we look for these terms in the subsequent text. We find that both terms are present in the following content. 

The causal statement for 'pleural effusion' could be: "Pleural effusion is caused when there is an excess formation and accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity. This can result from a variety of conditions such as infection, inflammation, heart failure or malignancy. In the given case, the blunting of the costophrenic angle, as noticed in the report, is a typical sign of pleural effusion. Additionally, the observation that one lung is not prominently larger than the other could suggest that the effusion is not severe enough to cause noticeable asymmetry in lung size."

For 'atelectasis', the causal statement can be: "Atelectasis is a condition where a part or the whole lung collapses, typically due to obstruction of the bronchi or pressure on the outside of the lung. In this case, the report mentions that both lungs are well expanded and similar in volume, which is contrary to what would be expected in atelectasis. However, it's possible that a small area of atelectasis could be present without significantly altering the overall volume of the lung."

Therefore, the 'Causal Exploration' would be: "The pleural effusion and atelectasis identified are supported by the findings in the report. The location information and the radiological observations align with the typical presentations of these conditions as described in the causal statements. The effusion and atelectasis could be related to various underlying conditions, which could be further investigated for a definitive diagnosis."
