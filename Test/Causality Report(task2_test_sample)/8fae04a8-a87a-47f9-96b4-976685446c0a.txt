In the context of 'Causal Exploration', the following observations can be made:

1. 'Cardiomegaly' was identified. The location of this condition is specified as 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Ventricle', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Ventricle'. The related causal statement is: "When assessing cardiac size, the cardiothoracic ratio exceeds 50 and is not within the normal range.". This suggests an enlarged heart, a typical feature of cardiomegaly.

2. 'Pleural effusion' was also detected. The location of this condition is specified as 'Pleural', 'Left Pleural', 'Pleural', 'Right Pleural'. The related causal statement is: "When tracing the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, the costophrenic angle is not blunted.". This suggests the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, a typical feature of pleural effusion.

3. 'Edema' was another finding. Although the specific location of this condition is not defined, it generally occurs in the lung parenchyma. The related causal statement is: "When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other.". This suggests the presence of excess fluid in the lungs, a typical feature of edema.

These causal statements help to explain the presence of these conditions in the patient and provide a foundation for further medical investigation and treatment.
