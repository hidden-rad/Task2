Causal Exploration:

The presence of 'pleural effusion' and 'pneumonia' (A4), identified in the location information (A2) and their respective text spans (A3), have significant implications for the patient's health. 

In the case of 'pleural effusion', the normal lung expansion might be affected, as one lung may appear prominently larger than the other (as mentioned in A5). This could be due to the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, leading to an expansion of the chest cavity. Moreover, the statement about the 'costophrenic angle blunting' can be related to pleural effusion, as this is a common radiographic sign of the condition.

As for 'pneumonia', it could be the reason for the 'abnormally increased density area' in the lung zones noted in A5. Pneumonia often presents as an increased opacity on radiographs due to the consolidation and inflammation of the lung tissue.

Therefore, the abnormalities noted in the lung expansion and density might be caused by the identified conditions: 'pleural effusion' and 'pneumonia'. However, further diagnostic tests are necessary to confirm these findings.
