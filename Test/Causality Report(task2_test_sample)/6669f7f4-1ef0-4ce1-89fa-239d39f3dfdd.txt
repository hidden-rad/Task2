Based on the given information, the word 'granuloma' is found in the list and its location information is provided. However, there is no explicit mention of the word 'granuloma' in the list. Therefore, a direct causal exploration for 'granuloma' cannot be made from the given set of statements.

However, if 'granuloma' relates to an "abnormally increased density area" mentioned in the list, a possible causal explanation could be: 

"Causal Exploration - The granuloma found in the 'Parenchyme', 'RUL(Right Upper Lobe)', and 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)' at the specified location might be the cause for the abnormally increased density area observed in the lungs. Further investigations are necessary to confirm this." 

This statement assumes a possible causal relationship based on the given information and the statements in the list. It should be noted that this is a hypothetical assumption and actual medical interpretation may vary.
