Causal Exploration: The finding of 'pleural effusion' (A1) located in the 'Left Pleural' area (A2) as indicated by the positional information {'begin': 10, 'end': 12} (A3), is causally related to the blunting of the costophrenic angle. This radiological sign, often observed when the lateral margins of the lung are traced to the costophrenic angles, suggests the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, which is consistent with the diagnosis of pleural effusion (A4)."
