After reviewing the given information, the term "pleural effusion" found in list A4 refers to a condition where there is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, the cavity between the lung and the chest wall. 

Looking at the list A5, the statement "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting." is relevant to pleural effusion. The blunting of costophrenic angle is a common radiological sign of pleural effusion. 

Hence, the causal explanation combining the findings A1 - A4 would be:

"Causal Exploration: The finding of 'pleural effusion' (A1) located in the 'Left Pleural' area (A2) as indicated by the positional information {'begin': 10, 'end': 12} (A3), is causally related to the blunting of the costophrenic angle. This radiological sign, often observed when the lateral margins of the lung are traced to the costophrenic angles, suggests the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, which is consistent with the diagnosis of pleural effusion (A4)."
