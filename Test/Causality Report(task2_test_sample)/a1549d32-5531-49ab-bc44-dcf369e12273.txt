Causal Exploration: 

The diagnosis of pneumonia was determined based on the location information in the 'Parenchyme' and the 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)'. The location specifics were identified between the 8th and 9th positions. This finding is significant because pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs, and it can occur in a specific lobe of the lung (in this case, the Right Lower Lobe). 

In the context of the provided statements, the pneumonia could explain the anomalies or changes such as abnormally increased density area, which could be due to the accumulation of pus or fluid in the lungs from the infection. However, it's crucial to note that most other observations listed do not directly relate to the findings of pneumonia. They are mostly normal findings or observations, indicating that other areas of the respiratory system do not show abnormal signs or symptoms associated with pneumonia or other conditions. 

Hence, the causal explanation linking the diagnosis of pneumonia to the provided statements would be that while pneumonia was found in the Right Lower Lobe, no other abnormal signs were observed in the other parts of the respiratory system.
