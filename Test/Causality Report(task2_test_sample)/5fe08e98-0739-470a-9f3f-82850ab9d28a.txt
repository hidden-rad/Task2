Causal Exploration: The occurrence of cardiomegaly, edema, and pleural effusion, as found in A1, can be explained by the detailed observations given in A5. These conditions are present in various parts of the body as specified in A2, indicating a widespread impact on the patient's health. The observations made about the trachea, bronchi, lungs, heart, and other parts of the body contribute to the diagnosis of these conditions. The cardiothoracic ratio being over 50, for instance, is a direct cause of cardiomegaly. Similarly, abnormal aspects observed in the lungs and heart contribute to the occurrence of edema and pleural effusion. Thus, the findings of A1~4 are causally linked and explained through these observations.
