In A4, the words ['cardiomegaly',  'edema',  'pleural effusion'] are related to A5, where each of these medical conditions are explained in detail. 

For instance, 'cardiomegaly' in A5 is described with observations such as "When assess cardiac size, cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 and not in the normal range." This indicates an enlarged heart, which is the definition of cardiomegaly. Similarly, 'edema' and 'pleural effusion' are also explained through various observations. 

In terms of location information of these conditions mentioned in A2, they are found in regions such as 'Parenchyme', 'RML(Right Middle Lobe)', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)', 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)', 'RUL(Right Upper Lobe)', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Atrium', 'Right Ventricle', 'Left Atrium', 'Left Ventricle', 'Left Pleural', and 'Right Pleural'. This shows that these conditions are widespread and not confined to a single area of the body.

The findings in A1 [cardiomegaly edema pleural effusion] align with the explanations given in A5 and the locations given in A2. Therefore, we can infer a causal relationship between these elements. 

Causal Explanation: The occurrence of cardiomegaly, edema, and pleural effusion, as found in A1, can be explained by the detailed observations given in A5. These conditions are present in various parts of the body as specified in A2, indicating a widespread impact on the patient's health. The observations made about the trachea, bronchi, lungs, heart, and other parts of the body contribute to the diagnosis of these conditions. The cardiothoracic ratio being over 50, for instance, is a direct cause of cardiomegaly. Similarly, abnormal aspects observed in the lungs and heart contribute to the occurrence of edema and pleural effusion. Thus, the findings of A1~4 are causally linked and explained through these observations.
