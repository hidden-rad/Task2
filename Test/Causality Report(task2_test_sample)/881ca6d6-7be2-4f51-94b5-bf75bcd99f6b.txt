By analyzing the document that contains the word 'pneumonia', we can relate it to another document which includes various descriptions of lung and respiratory conditions. 

One of the statements in the latter document, "When compare the apical,upper,middle and lower zones in turn, there is an abnormally increased density area.", can be associated with pneumonia. Pneumonia is a lung condition that's characterized by inflammation of the airspaces in the lungs, most commonly due to an infection. Pneumonia can result in increased density areas in the lungs due to the accumulation of fluid and pus. 

Therefore, for Causal Exploration, we add:

"When compare the apical,upper,middle and lower zones in turn, there is an abnormally increased density area. This finding is consistent with the discovery of pneumonia. The location information indicating the 'Parenchyme', 'RML(Right Middle Lobe)', and the location details further supports the diagnosis of pneumonia. The increased lung density often observed in pneumonia cases is due to the infection causing fluid and pus to fill the lung, which shows up on imaging scans as areas of increased density."
