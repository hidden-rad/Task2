Causal Exploration: The discovery of pleural effusion in both the right and left pleural regions, as indicated by the location information, is leading to the blunting of the costophrenic angle. This abnormal build-up of fluid in the pleural space can result in the blunting of the costophrenic angle as seen in the chest X-ray, providing a causal explanation for this observation. This is significant as it aids in the diagnosis and treatment of the patient's condition.
