From A4, both 'cardiomegaly' and 'pleural effusion' are relevant to A5. Cardiomegaly refers to an enlarged heart, while pleural effusion refers to the build-up of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs. 

The 'Causal Exploration' for these findings could be:

Cardiomegaly: The heart is enlarged, as indicated by a cardiothoracic ratio over 50, which is not in the normal range. This could be due to various causes such as high blood pressure, heart valve issues, or diseases of the heart muscle. 

Pleural Effusion: The presence of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs is indicative of pleural effusion. This could be due to conditions like pneumonia, tuberculosis, or lung cancer. It can also occur due to heart failure, which might explain the concurrent finding of cardiomegaly.

Both these conditions require further medical evaluation for a definitive diagnosis and treatment. It's also important to note that both conditions can affect the functioning of the heart and lungs and can lead to serious complications if left untreated. 

Therefore, the 'Causal Exploration' of A5 is that the findings of cardiomegaly and pleural effusion suggest possible heart and lung diseases, which are substantiated by the findings of A1~4.
