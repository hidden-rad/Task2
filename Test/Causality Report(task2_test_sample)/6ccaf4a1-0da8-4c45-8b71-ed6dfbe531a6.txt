Causal Exploration: The pleural effusion observed was located in the 'Right Pleural' area with specific location information. This is consistent with the description which noted 'costophrenic angle is blunting,' a common finding in pleural effusion. The pleural effusion could be due to various causes such as pneumonia, heart failure, or other lung conditions. 

Similarly, the pneumothorax was also noted in the findings. The description mentions 'When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other,' which could be an indication of pneumothorax, where air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall. This could have been caused by a blunt or penetrating chest injury, certain medical procedures, or damage from underlying lung disease.

It's important to note that these are just hypothetical Causal Explorations based on the given information and actual medical diagnoses should always be made by a qualified healthcare provider.
