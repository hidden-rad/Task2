After examining the provided information, it is clear that the term 'cardiomegaly' is indeed relevant to the statement that reads, 'When assessing cardiac size, the cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 and not within the normal range.' This suggests an enlarged heart, which is the definition of cardiomegaly.

Therefore, the 'Causal Explanation' could be: 

"The discovery of 'cardiomegaly' in the list ['cardiomegaly'] corresponds to the location information of the finding within the 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Atrium', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Atrium', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Ventricle', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Ventricle' and [{'begin': 6, 'end': 11}]. This is causally explained by the abnormal cardiothoracic ratio mentioned in the statement, 'When assessing cardiac size, the cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 and not within the normal range.' This high cardiothoracic ratio indicates an enlargement of the heart, which is a clinical manifestation of cardiomegaly."
