Causal Explanation:

1. An abnormal enlargement of the heart, known as 'Cardiomegaly', was discovered in various locations including the 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Atrium', 'Left Atrium', 'Right Ventricle', and 'Left Ventricle'. This condition could be a result of numerous causes such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, or heart valve disorders. Upon evaluating the size of the heart, it was observed that the cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 and not within the normal range, indicating the presence of cardiomegaly. 

2. Additionally, 'Pleural effusion', which is an accumulation of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs, was also detected in areas such as 'Pleural', 'Right Pleural', and 'Left Pleural'. This could be due to conditions like pneumonia, tuberculosis, or lung cancer. When examining the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, it was noted that the costophrenic angle is not blunted, a common sign of pleural effusion.

The findings suggest that the patient is currently dealing with cardiomegaly and pleural effusion. These conditions may be interconnected, as heart issues like cardiomegaly can occasionally lead to pleural effusion due to the increased pressure in the heart and blood vessels. This can result in fluid leaking into the pleural space, causing pleural effusion. Further examinations and medical interventions are required to verify these findings and to address the root causes.
