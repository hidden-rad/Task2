To find a part in A4 relevant to A5, we can examine the findings mentioned in QA5. Both 'atelectasis' and 'pleural effusion' are mentioned. 

Atelectasis is a condition in which the airways and air sacs in the lung collapse or do not expand properly. Pleural effusion is an abnormal amount of fluid around the lung.

Related to these, in A1, we found atelectasis and pleural effusion. In A2, the location information of the findings was mentioned as 'Parenchyme', 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', 'Pleural', 'Left Pleural', 'Right Pleural'. These are the areas where atelectasis and pleural effusion were detected. A3 provides the specific locations of these findings.

Causal Explanation: Atelectasis and pleural effusion, as found in A1 and described in A4, were caused by abnormalities in the 'Parenchyme', 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', 'Pleural', 'Left Pleural', 'Right Pleural', as specified in A2. The specific locations of these findings, provided in A3, further support this causation. The findings of atelectasis and pleural effusion are consistent with the descriptions provided in QA5. Therefore, it can be concluded that the atelectasis and pleural effusion are a result of the aforementioned abnormalities, providing a causal explanation for the findings in A1~4.
