From A4, the keywords 'cardiomegaly' and 'pleural effusion' are relevant to A5. 

The causal explanation can be constructed as follows:

Causal Explanation:

1. 'Cardiomegaly' (A1), which is the abnormal enlargement of the heart, was found in the locations ['Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Atrium', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Atrium', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Ventricle', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Ventricle'] (A2). This condition could be due to a variety of causes such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, or heart valve disorders. When assessing the cardiac size, it was noted that the cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 and not in the normal range, indicating cardiomegaly. 

2. 'Pleural effusion' (A1), a build-up of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs, was also detected in the locations ['Pleural', 'Right Pleural', None, 'Pleural', 'Left Pleural', None] (A2). This could be due to conditions such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, or lung cancer. When tracing the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, it was observed that the costophrenic angle is not blunted, which is a common sign of pleural effusion.

The findings from A1, A2, and A3 suggest that the patient is currently suffering from cardiomegaly and pleural effusion. These conditions may be related, as heart problems such as cardiomegaly can sometimes cause pleural effusion due to the increased pressure in the heart and blood vessels. This can cause fluid to leak into the pleural space, leading to pleural effusion. Further tests and medical interventions are needed to confirm these findings and to treat the underlying conditions.
