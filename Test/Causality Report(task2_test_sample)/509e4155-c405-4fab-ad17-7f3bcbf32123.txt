Causal Exploration: The findings of cardiomegaly and pneumothorax (A1), which have been located in the regions including the 'Parenchyme', 'Right Upper Lobe', 'Mediastinum', 'Heart', 'Left Atrium', 'Right Atrium', and 'Right Ventricle' (A2), and the specific location information (A3), can be causally explained by the abnormal increase in the size of the heart and the presence of air in the pleural space causing lung collapse. These changes are outlined in the detailed descriptions provided in A5. 

The cardiothoracic ratio exceeding 50 indicates an enlarged heart, which could cause pressure on surrounding structures leading to symptoms and complications associated with cardiomegaly. Similarly, the presence of air in the pleural space would cause one lung to not expand as it should, leading to symptoms and complications associated with pneumothorax.
