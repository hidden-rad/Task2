A4, as stated, is the list of words ['cardiomegaly',  'pneumothorax']. A5 provides detailed descriptions of the conditions cardiomegaly and pneumothorax.

Looking at A5, 'cardiomegaly' is described in detail with statements relating to the abnormal size of the heart and its effects on surrounding structures. Similarly, 'pneumothorax' is described with statements detailing the abnormal presence of air in the pleural space causing lung collapse.

Relevant parts of A5 to A4 could be statements like "When assess cardiac size, cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 and not in the normal range" for 'cardiomegaly', and "When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other" for 'pneumothorax'. 

To causally explain the findings from A1~4, we can add:

Causal Exploration: The findings of cardiomegaly and pneumothorax (A1), which have been located in the regions including the 'Parenchyme', 'Right Upper Lobe', 'Mediastinum', 'Heart', 'Left Atrium', 'Right Atrium', and 'Right Ventricle' (A2), and the specific location information (A3), can be causally explained by the abnormal increase in the size of the heart and the presence of air in the pleural space causing lung collapse. These changes are outlined in the detailed descriptions provided in A5. 

The cardiothoracic ratio exceeding 50 indicates an enlarged heart, which could cause pressure on surrounding structures leading to symptoms and complications associated with cardiomegaly. Similarly, the presence of air in the pleural space would cause one lung to not expand as it should, leading to symptoms and complications associated with pneumothorax.
