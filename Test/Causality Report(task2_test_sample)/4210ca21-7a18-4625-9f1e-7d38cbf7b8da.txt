Causal Exploration: 
The finding of pleural effusion in the right and left pleural as indicated by the location information, is causing the blunting of the costophrenic angle. This abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space can lead to the blunting of the costophrenic angle observed in the chest X-ray, providing a Causal Exploration for this observation. This is important as it helps in the diagnosis and management of the patient's condition.
