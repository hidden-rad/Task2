From A5, the part relevant to A4 (pleural effusion) is "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting." Pleural effusion is a condition where there is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space between the lungs and the chest wall, which can cause the blunting of the costophrenic angle in a chest X-ray.

Causal Exploration: 
The finding of pleural effusion (A1) in the right and left pleural (A2) as indicated by the location information from A3, is causing the blunting of the costophrenic angle. This abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space can lead to the blunting of the costophrenic angle observed in the chest X-ray, providing a causal explanation for this observation. This is important as it helps in the diagnosis and management of the patient's condition.
