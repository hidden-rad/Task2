The relevant part in A4 to A5 is the 'pleural effusion'. 

Pleural effusion refers to the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, which is the cavity between the lungs and the chest wall.

Causal Explanation:
The finding of 'pleural effusion' (A1) was identified in the location ['Pleural', 'Left Pleural', None] (A2) with the specific coordinates [{'begin': 6, 'end': 12}] (A3). This condition could have been caused by various factors such as pneumonia, heart failure, liver disease or kidney disease. 

In the context of the provided statements (A5), the statement "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting." could indicate the presence of pleural effusion. The blunting of the costophrenic angle is a common sign seen in patients with this condition. The fluid build-up in the pleural space can cause the normally sharp and distinct costophrenic angle to appear blunted or obscured on imaging studies. 

This is the causal explanation for the identified 'pleural effusion' and its associated findings.
