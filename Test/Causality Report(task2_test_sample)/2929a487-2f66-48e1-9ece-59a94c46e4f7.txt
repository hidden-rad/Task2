Causal Exploration:

The findings of cardiomegaly and pleural effusion in A1 are supported by the location information in A2 and A3. The enlargement of the heart and the unusual fluid accumulation in the pleural space may be causing the abnormal observations mentioned in A5. The cardiothoracic ratio being over 50 suggests an enlarged heart, possibly due to conditions like heart disease or high blood pressure. The non-blunted costophrenic angle and the absence of subcutaneous emphysema could be due to the pleural effusion, which is often caused by conditions such as pneumonia, liver disease, or kidney disease. Therefore, the findings of A1~4 can causally explain the observed abnormalities in A5.
