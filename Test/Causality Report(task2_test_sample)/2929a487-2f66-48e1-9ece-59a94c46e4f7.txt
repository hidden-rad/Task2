In A4, the words 'cardiomegaly' and 'pleural effusion' are directly related to A5. Cardiomegaly refers to an enlarged heart which is evident in the statement "When assess cardiac size, cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 and not in the normal range" from A5. Similarly, pleural effusion, which refers to the build-up of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs, is related to several statements in A5 such as "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is not blunted." and "When review the upper abdomen, soft tissues and take a look at some final check areas, there is no subcutaneous emphysema."

Causal Exploration:

The findings of cardiomegaly and pleural effusion in A1 are supported by the location information in A2 and A3. The enlargement of the heart and the unusual fluid accumulation in the pleural space may be causing the abnormal observations mentioned in A5. The cardiothoracic ratio being over 50 suggests an enlarged heart, possibly due to conditions like heart disease or high blood pressure. The non-blunted costophrenic angle and the absence of subcutaneous emphysema could be due to the pleural effusion, which is often caused by conditions such as pneumonia, liver disease, or kidney disease. Therefore, the findings of A1~4 can causally explain the observed abnormalities in A5.
