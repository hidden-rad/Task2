Causal Exploration:

The findings of cardiomegaly and pleural effusion are supported by the location information. The enlargement of the heart and the unusual fluid accumulation in the pleural space may be causing the abnormal observations. The cardiothoracic ratio being over 50 suggests an enlarged heart, possibly due to conditions like heart disease or high blood pressure. The non-blunted costophrenic angle and the absence of subcutaneous emphysema could be due to the pleural effusion, which is often caused by conditions such as pneumonia, liver disease, or kidney disease. Therefore, these findings can causally explain the observed abnormalities.
