Causal Exploration: The contusion might have resulted from an external blunt force trauma to the chest, which could have damaged the lung tissue. This damage might have also initiated an inflammatory response, leading to the build-up of fluid in the pleural space and consequently a pleural effusion. The locations of these findings suggest that the trauma was probably concentrated on the left side of the chest. The exact causes of these findings would require more investigation, including a review of medical history and further diagnostic tests.
