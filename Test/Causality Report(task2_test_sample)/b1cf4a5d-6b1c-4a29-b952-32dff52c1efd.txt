Causal Exploration: The discovery of a pleural effusion is noteworthy. This condition is found in the 'Pleural' or 'Right Pleural' areas and pinpointed within a specific section of the text. Pleural effusion is characterized by the accumulation of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs. It is frequently linked with pneumonia, heart failure, liver disease, or kidney disease. 

In the context of the given report, the phrase "costophrenic angle is blunting" could suggest the presence of this condition. A blunted costophrenic angle is often indicative of pleural effusion. It results from fluid buildup in the pleural space, which blurs the sharp angle between the diaphragm and the chest wall. This could be the reason for the detected pleural effusion in this instance. Further medical action might be necessary to remove the fluid and address the root cause.
