Causal Exploration:

'Pneumonia' is a condition that causes inflammation in the air sacs in the lungs, which may result in fluid or pus filling up these sacs and leading to symptoms such as coughing, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. This condition can be detected by tracing down the trachea to the carina, where there might be a deviation. It can also be seen when comparing the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones in turn, where an abnormally increased density area might be found due to the fluid or pus. 

'Atelectasis', on the other hand, is a condition where the air sacs in the lungs collapse or do not inflate properly. This can be seen when both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, but one lung is not prominently larger than the other. Further, when tracing down both main bronchi, the bronchial might have narrowed or been cut off due to the collapse of the air sacs.

Both these conditions can cause changes in the normal functioning of the lungs, which might be reflected in the findings. This is why it is crucial to utilize the location information of the findings to accurately diagnose these conditions.
