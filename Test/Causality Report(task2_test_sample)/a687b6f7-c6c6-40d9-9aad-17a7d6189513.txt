Based on the given data, the relevant part in A4 to A5 is 'emphysema' and 'pneumothorax'. 

The causal explanation can be constructed as follows:

"Causal Exploration: The findings of 'emphysema' and 'pneumothorax' (A1) located in 'Parenchyme', 'RUL(Right Upper Lobe)', and 'Subcutaneous tissue' (A2) between the beginning and end (A3) correlate with the medical conditions mentioned in A5. Specifically, the presence of 'emphysema' can be linked to the statement 'When review the upper abdomen, soft tissues and take a look at some final check areas, there is no subcutaneous emphysema.' Similarly, the finding of 'pneumothorax' is relevant to the statements including 'When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other.' and 'When trace down the trachea to the carina, there is no tracheal deviation.' This suggests that the abnormalities in the lungs and trachea could be due to these conditions."

Please note that this is a hypothetical explanation and may need to be adjusted based on the actual medical context and patient's medical history.
