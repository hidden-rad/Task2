Causal Exploration: The mass identified in the Parenchyme and Left Upper Lobe could be the reason for the abnormally increased density area observed in the apical, upper, middle and lower zones. On the other hand, the pleural effusion associated with the Pleural and Left Pleural could be causing the non-blunted costophrenic angle observed in the lateral margins of the lung. 

Please note that this is a hypothetical explanation and further medical evaluation and tests would be needed to confirm these findings and their causal relationships.
