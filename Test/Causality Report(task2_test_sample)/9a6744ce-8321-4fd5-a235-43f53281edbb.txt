From A4, the relevant findings are 'mass' and 'pleural effusion'. 

In A5, the sentences related to these findings could be ""When compare the apical,upper,middle and lower zones in turn, there is an abnormally increased density area.", which may refer to the 'mass' and ""When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is not blunted.", which could possibly refer to the 'pleural effusion'.

The findings of A1, which is [mass pleural effusion] can be causally related to the location information of A2 and A3. The 'mass' is located in the 'Parenchyme' and 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)', while the 'pleural effusion' is related to the 'Pleural' and 'Left Pleural'. 

The causal explanation could be as follows:

Causal Exploration: The mass identified in the Parenchyme and LUL(Left Upper Lobe) could be the reason for the abnormally increased density area observed in the apical,upper,middle and lower zones. On the other hand, the pleural effusion associated with the Pleural and Left Pleural could be causing the non-blunted costophrenic angle observed in the lateral margins of the lung. 

Please note that this is a hypothetical explanation and further medical evaluation and tests would be needed to confirm these findings and their causal relationships.
