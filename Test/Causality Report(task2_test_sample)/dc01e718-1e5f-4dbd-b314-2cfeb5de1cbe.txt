Causal Exploration: The term "atelectasis" is relevant to the discussion. Atelectasis refers to the partial or complete collapse of a part of the lung, which can occur due to various reasons such as blockage of the airways (bronchi or bronchioles) or pressure from outside the lung. 

In the context of the findings where 'atelectasis' has been identified, it can be traced back to the details mentioned in the discussion. For instance, the statements such as "When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is prominently larger than the other." and "When comparing the apical, upper, middle and lower zones in turn, there is an abnormally increased density area." These observations could indicate atelectasis as the lung is not properly expanded and there is an increase in density in certain areas, a characteristic of atelectasis.

Furthermore, the location information points out the areas in the lungs (Parenchyme, RUL(Right Upper Lobe), RLL(Right Lower Lobe), RML(Right Middle Lobe)) where these findings have been observed. The details provide the specific range (begin: 1, end: 12) within which these findings have been noted.

In conclusion, the findings suggest the presence of atelectasis in the identified locations within the lungs. This could be due to blockages in the airways or pressure on the lungs, leading to the observed symptoms and the noted condition.
