Based on the given information, A4 contains the word 'pleural effusion'. Referencing QA5, the statement relevant to 'pleural effusion' is "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting."

From A1, we know this is a finding of 'pleural effusion', and from A2 and A3, we know the location information of this finding. 

Causal Explanation: The finding of pleural effusion, located as per A2 and A3, can be explained by the observation that the costophrenic angle is blunting. This physical change can lead to the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, resulting in pleural effusion.
