Causal Exploration: 
The finding of 'cardiomegaly' (A1) in the locations ['Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Atrium', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Atrium', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Ventricle', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Ventricle'] (A2) with the location information [{'begin': 6, 'end': 9}] (A3) can be causally explained by the following: 

When assessing cardiac size, the cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 and not in the normal range. This indicates an enlargement of the heart, also known as cardiomegaly. This condition may be due to a number of reasons including heart failure, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, pericardial effusion, or some forms of congenital heart disease. This finding is important as it may have significant implications for the patient's health and management plan. Further investigations may be needed to identify the underlying cause and appropriate treatment options.
