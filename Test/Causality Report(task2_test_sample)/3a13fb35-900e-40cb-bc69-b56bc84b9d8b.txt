Causal Exploration: 
The presence of pneumonia and lymphadenopathy can be explained by the abnormalities noticed in the chest X-ray findings. The increased density area in the apical, upper, middle and lower zones of the lungs, which is not symmetrical, could indicate an infection like pneumonia. Furthermore, the presence of lymphadenopathy could be related to the abnormality found in the hilar vessels. 

The position information of these findings, specifically in the right hilum, left hilum, and in the parenchyme of RML (Right Middle Lobe) and LUL (Left Upper Lobe), corroborate the presence of these conditions. The indices further pinpoint the precise location of these findings within the text data. 

Hence, the causal statement would be: The presence of pneumonia and lymphadenopathy is due to the abnormalities seen in the chest X-ray findings, specifically the increased density areas in the lungs and the abnormal hilar vessels. The location of these findings further confirm the presence of these conditions.
