Causal Exploration: The discovery of a 'pneumothorax' is causally connected to the observation that "When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not noticeably larger than the other." This abnormality in lung expansion could be due to the presence of a pneumothorax. This is further supported by location information, specifically the presence of pneumothorax in the 'Parenchyme', 'Right Lower Lobe', and 'Right Middle Lobe'. The pneumothorax, a collection of air or gas in the chest or pleural space that causes part or all of a lung to collapse, could result in one lung appearing larger than the other due to the collapse of the affected lung.
