Causal Explanation: The discovery of 'cardiomegaly' is validated by the observations of its presence in various parts of the heart including the 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Atrium', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Atrium', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Ventricle', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Ventricle'. The location information further corroborates this. This condition is often triggered by high blood pressure or coronary artery disease. It is this enlargement of the heart that results in the cardiothoracic ratio exceeding 50 and falling outside the normal range. Therefore, the enlarged heart contributes to the abnormal cardiothoracic ratio, signaling a need for medical intervention.
