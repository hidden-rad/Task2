Causal Exploration:

1. Atelectasis: This condition can be caused by a blockage of the air passages (bronchi or bronchioles) or by pressure on the outside of the lung. In the given context, the statement "When trace down both main bronchi, the bronchial has not narrowed or cut off." is relevant as it explains the absence of any obstruction in the bronchi, which could potentially cause atelectasis.

2. Pleural Effusion: This condition occurs when excess fluid builds up between the layers of the pleura, the thin membrane that lines the inside of your chest wall and surrounds your lungs. In the given context, the statement "WWhen trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is not blunted." is relevant as it explains the absence of any abnormal fluid accumulation, which could potentially indicate a pleural effusion.

To relate these Causal Explorations to the findings of A1~4, it can be stated that the absence of any bronchial obstruction and abnormal fluid accumulation as identified in A5 suggest that the patient does not have atelectasis or pleural effusion. However, further tests and medical examination might be necessary to confirm this.
