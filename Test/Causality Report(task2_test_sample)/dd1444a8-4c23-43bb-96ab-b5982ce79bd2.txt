Since the terms in A4 (['pleural effusion']) and the statements in A5 are related to different aspects of a medical examination, there seems to be no direct causal relationship between them. 

However, if we take a closer look at A5, we can find a statement related to pleural effusion, which is "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting.". Pleural effusion can cause blunting of the costophrenic angles. 

So, we can construct a causal explanation as follows:

Causal Exploration: The findings (A1) of 'pleural effusion' in the list (A4) can be linked to the observation in A5 stating "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting.". This is because pleural effusion, which is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space (as indicated by the location information A2 and A3), can lead to the blunting of costophrenic angles as the fluid occupies the space and changes the angle's appearance. This provides a causal explanation of the observed medical condition.
