Causal Exploration: The finding of 'pleural effusion' (A1) identified in the location ['Pleural', 'Right Pleural', None] (A2) and [{'begin': 8, 'end': 9}] (A3) can be correlated with the statement 'When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting.' from A5. This suggests that the excess fluid build-up is causing the costophrenic angle to blunt, a typical sign of pleural effusion."
