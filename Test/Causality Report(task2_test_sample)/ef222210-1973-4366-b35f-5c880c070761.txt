Causal Exploration: The finding of 'pleural effusion' identified in the location ['Pleural', 'Right Pleural', None] and [{'begin': 8, 'end': 9}] can be correlated with the statement 'When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting.' This suggests that the excess fluid build-up is causing the costophrenic angle to blunt, a typical sign of pleural effusion.
