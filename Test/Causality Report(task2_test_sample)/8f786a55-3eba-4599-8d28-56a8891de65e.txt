Causal Exploration: The presence of 'atelectasis' and 'cardiomegaly' could be due to the abnormalities spotted. The abnormal increase in density area in the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones possibly resulted in 'atelectasis'. On the other hand, the normal cardiothoracic ratio is likely to be an indicator of 'cardiomegaly'. These findings are consistent with the location information provided. Thus, the findings of 'atelectasis' and 'cardiomegaly' can be causally linked to the observed abnormalities.
