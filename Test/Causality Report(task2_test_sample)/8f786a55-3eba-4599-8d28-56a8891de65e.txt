Based on the information given, we can see that the findings relevant to 'atelectasis' and 'cardiomegaly' in A4 are mentioned in A5. For 'atelectasis', the statement "When compare the apical,upper,middle and lower zones in turn, there is an abnormally increased density area." is relevant. For 'cardiomegaly', the statement "When assess cardiac size, cardiothoracic ratio does not exceed 50 and is in the normal range." is relevant. 

Therefore, we can construct the causal explanation as follows:

Causal Exploration: The presence of 'atelectasis' and 'cardiomegaly' found in A1 could be due to the abnormalities spotted in A2 and A3. The abnormal increase in density area in the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones possibly resulted in 'atelectasis', as mentioned in A5. On the other hand, the normal cardiothoracic ratio, also mentioned in A5, is likely to be an indicator of 'cardiomegaly'. These findings are consistent with the location information provided in A3. Thus, the findings of 'atelectasis' and 'cardiomegaly' in A1 can be causally linked to the abnormalities observed in A2 and A3.
