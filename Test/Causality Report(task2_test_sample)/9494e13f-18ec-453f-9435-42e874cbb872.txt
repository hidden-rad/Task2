The relevant part in A4 to A5 is 'pneumothorax'. 

A pneumothorax refers to the presence of air or gas in the cavity between the lungs and the chest wall, causing the lung to collapse. 

Causal Explanation:

The finding of 'pneumothorax' (A1) in the 'Parenchyme' and 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)' (A2) locations, with the specific location information provided (A3), can be causally linked to the observations in A5. The presence of a pneumothorax can cause significant changes in the chest anatomy, which may explain the observed abnormalities. 

For instance, a pneumothorax can cause the trachea to deviate, alter the volume of the lungs, affect the expansion of the lungs, and cause asymmetry in the apical, upper, middle and lower zones. Additionally, a pneumothorax can cause an increase in the density area, alter the position of the hilum, affect the branching of the lung vessels, and even influence the shape of the costophrenic angle. 

Furthermore, a pneumothorax can also affect the position of the diaphragm, the clarity of the cardiac borders, the position and size of the aortic arch and pulmonary trunk, and the width of the upper mediastinum. Changes may also be observed in the hilar vessels, the posterior ribs, and other bony structures of the chest. 

In severe cases, pneumothorax can cause subcutaneous emphysema and hiatus hernia, and even lead to the presence of free gas under the diaphragms. 

Hence, the presence of a pneumothorax can have wide-ranging effects on the chest anatomy, which are reflected in the abnormalities observed in A5. 

This is the 'Causal Explanation' of how the finding of 'pneumothorax' relates to the observations made in A5.
