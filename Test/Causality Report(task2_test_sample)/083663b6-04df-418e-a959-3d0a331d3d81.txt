Causal Exploration:
1. Emphysema: The presence of subcutaneous emphysema can be caused by a rupture in the airways or lung tissue, which allows air to escape into the subcutaneous tissues. This condition was identified through certain processes.

2. Pleural Effusion: The absence of certain findings such as lack of blunted costophrenic angles or no abnormalities in the hilar vessels could indicate that there is no pleural effusion. However, further investigations are needed as these signs are not definitive. 

3. Pneumothorax: The fact that both lungs are well expanded and similar in volume, alongside other normal findings, suggests there is no pneumothorax present. This is in accordance with the findings from previous processes. 

Thus, the Causal Explorations for these conditions are derived from certain findings and are further supported by additional details.
