Causal Exploration:
1. Emphysema: The presence of subcutaneous emphysema as indicated in A5 can be caused by a rupture in the airways or lung tissue, which allows air to escape into the subcutaneous tissues. This can be linked back to A1~A4 as the condition was identified through these processes.

2. Pleural Effusion: The absence of certain findings in A5 such as lack of blunted costophrenic angles or no abnormalities in the hilar vessels could indicate that there is no pleural effusion. However, further investigations are needed as these signs are not definitive. 

3. Pneumothorax: The fact that both lungs are well expanded and similar in volume as stated in A5, alongside other normal findings, suggests there is no pneumothorax present. This is in accordance with the findings from A1~A4. 

Thus, the Causal Explorations for these conditions are derived from the findings in A1~A4 and are further supported by the details in A5.
