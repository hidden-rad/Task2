Causal Exploration: 
The finding of 'cardiomegaly' (A1) is located in the 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Atrium', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Atrium', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Ventricle', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Ventricle' (A2). The location information is specified with the range {'begin': 5, 'end': 11} (A3). 

This is causally explained by the fact that cardiomegaly is a medical condition where the heart is enlarged. This enlargement could affect the overall shape and size of the Mediastinum and the Atria and Ventricles specifically. It's observed in the X-ray findings that the cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 which is not in the normal range, indicating an enlarged heart or cardiomegaly. This can be due to various reasons such as high blood pressure, heart valve disease, or diseases of the heart muscle itself, which can cause the heart to pump harder and in turn, lead to its enlargement. 

This causal explanation provides an understanding of the correlation between the findings of cardiomegaly in A4 and the observed abnormalities in the X-ray findings in A5.
