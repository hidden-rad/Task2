Causal Exploration: The finding of 'pleural effusion' (A1) located at ['Pleural', 'Left Pleural', None] (A2) with location information [{'begin': 3, 'end': 12}] (A3) could explain the observed blunting of the costophrenic angle. Pleural effusion, which is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, can cause the costophrenic angle to appear blunt on a radiograph. This is a common indication used by radiologists to diagnose pleural effusion.
