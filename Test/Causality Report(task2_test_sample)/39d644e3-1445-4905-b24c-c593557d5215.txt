Given the provided information, it appears that 'pleural effusion' (A4) is relevant to the statement 'When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting.' from A5. This is because a blunting of the costophrenic angle can be a sign of a pleural effusion.

So, the causal explanation could be like:

Causal Exploration: The finding of 'pleural effusion' (A1) located at ['Pleural', 'Left Pleural', None] (A2) with location information [{'begin': 3, 'end': 12}] (A3) could explain the observed blunting of the costophrenic angle. Pleural effusion, which is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, can cause the costophrenic angle to appear blunt on a radiograph. This is a common indication used by radiologists to diagnose pleural effusion.
