Causal Exploration: The findings of an enlarged heart and a collapsed lung, which have been identified in regions such as the 'Parenchyme', 'Right Upper Lobe', 'Mediastinum', 'Heart', 'Left Atrium', 'Right Atrium', and 'Right Ventricle', can be causally explained by the abnormal increase in the size of the heart and the presence of air in the pleural space causing lung collapse. These changes are outlined in the detailed descriptions provided.

A cardiothoracic ratio exceeding 50 signifies an enlarged heart, which could exert pressure on surrounding structures leading to symptoms and complications associated with an enlarged heart. Similarly, the presence of air in the pleural space could cause one lung to not expand as it should, leading to symptoms and complications associated with a collapsed lung.
