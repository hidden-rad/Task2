Causal Exploration: 
The findings indicate the presence of 'cardiomegaly' and 'pleural effusion'. The radiological assessment shows an increased cardiothoracic ratio, suggesting an enlarged heart, a characteristic of cardiomegaly. Furthermore, the costophrenic angle is not blunted, a potential sign of pleural effusion. The location information (A2) and the associated data (A3) further confirm these findings. These conditions may have resulted from underlying diseases such as heart failure or lung infection, which need further medical investigation.
