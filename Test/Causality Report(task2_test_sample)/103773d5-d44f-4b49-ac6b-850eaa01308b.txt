Based on the given information, the relevant part in A4 (['cardiomegaly', 'pleural effusion']) related to A5 (QA5) is the presence of 'cardiomegaly' and 'pleural effusion'. 

In the list A5, several statements are associated with these conditions. For example, in case of 'cardiomegaly', the statement "When assess cardiac size, cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 and not in the normal range." is directly related. This indicates an abnormally enlarged heart which is the definition of 'cardiomegaly'.

Similarly, for 'pleural effusion', the statement "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is not blunted." is related. Pleural effusion is a condition where excess fluid builds up in the pleural space, the area between the lungs and the chest wall, which can cause blunting of the costophrenic angles.

Therefore, the causal explanation for the findings of A1~4 could be as follows:

Causal Exploration: 
The findings indicate the presence of 'cardiomegaly' and 'pleural effusion'. The radiological assessment shows an increased cardiothoracic ratio, suggesting an enlarged heart, a characteristic of cardiomegaly. Furthermore, the costophrenic angle is not blunted, a potential sign of pleural effusion. The location information (A2) and the associated data (A3) further confirm these findings. These conditions may have resulted from underlying diseases such as heart failure or lung infection, which need further medical investigation.
