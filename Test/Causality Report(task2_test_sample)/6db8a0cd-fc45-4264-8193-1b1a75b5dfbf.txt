Causal Exploration: The finding of 'pneumothorax' in the location ['Parenchyme', 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)', None] and [{'begin': 1, 'end': 5}] could cause the observed abnormalities in lung expansion and costophrenic angle. This is because a pneumothorax can cause a lung to collapse, which would make it appear less expanded and potentially alter the appearance of the costophrenic angles. This Causal Exploration helps to understand how these findings are related to the observed abnormalities.
