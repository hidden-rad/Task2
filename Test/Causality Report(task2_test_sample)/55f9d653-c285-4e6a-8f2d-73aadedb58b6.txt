Causal Exploration: The finding A1 'cardiomegaly' is substantiated by the observations in A2 - presence of the condition in various parts of the heart including 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Atrium', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Atrium', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Ventricle', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Ventricle'. The location information A3 also confirms the same. This condition is often caused by high blood pressure or coronary artery disease. It is this cardiomegaly that leads to the cardiothoracic ratio being over 50 and not in the normal range as observed in A5. Therefore, the cardiomegaly contributes to the abnormal cardiothoracic ratio, indicating a need for medical attention.
