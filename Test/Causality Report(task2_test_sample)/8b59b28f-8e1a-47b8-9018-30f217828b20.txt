Causal Exploration: 
The finding of atelectasis (A1) in the Left Lower Lobe (A2) of the lung, as indicated by the location information (A3), could be the cause for the observed asymmetry in lung volume. This condition, which involves the collapse or incomplete expansion of a lung, could explain why one lung is notably larger than the other as described in the statement from A5.
