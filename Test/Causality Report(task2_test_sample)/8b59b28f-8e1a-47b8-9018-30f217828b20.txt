In order to provide a causal explanation that relates the findings of A1 to A4, we need to identify a part in A4 that is relevant to A5. Given that A4 is ['atelectasis'] and A5 pertains to a set of statements about the normal functioning and structure of the lungs and other related organs, we can consider the statement, "When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other." 

Atelectasis, which is the partial or complete collapse of a lung or a section (lobe) of a lung, could cause one lung to be significantly larger than the other. 

With this in mind, we can construct the following causal statement: 

Causal Exploration: 
The finding of atelectasis (A1) in the Left Lower Lobe (A2) of the lung, as indicated by the location information (A3), could be the cause for the observed asymmetry in lung volume. This condition, which involves the collapse or incomplete expansion of a lung, could explain why one lung is notably larger than the other as described in the statement from A5.
