Causal Exploration: Fibrosis is a consequence of repeated injury and repair to the lung tissue. While the overall pulmonary health as indicated in A5 is good, the presence of fibrosis in various lobes of the lungs (as indicated in A2 and A3) suggests prior incidents of lung injury. It is important to identify and mitigate the cause of this damage to prevent further progression of fibrosis.
