Revised Explanation:

Taking into account the gathered findings, the occurrence of pleural effusion and congestion can be causally justified. 

The discovery of pleural effusion congestion implies a potential respiratory disorder. The location details of the discovery, which include both the right and left pleura, suggest that the disorder impacts both sides. This is further corroborated by the location details, which propose that the disorder begins at the 5th position and concludes at the 11th position within the body.

Regarding the additional data, the statements offer an in-depth analysis of the respiratory system. The statements reveal that there is no deviation in the trachea, the bronchial has not become narrow or severed, both lungs are well expanded and similar in volume, and there are no areas with abnormally increased density. However, these statements do not directly relate or link to the disorders of pleural effusion and congestion.

To causally justify the disorders of pleural effusion and congestion, it could be proposed that a potential cause may be inflammation or infection of the lungs, leading to an overproduction of fluid and mucus. This could result in the observed discoveries of pleural effusion and congestion. However, further medical examination would be required to verify the cause and suitable treatment. 

This causal exploration aims to associate the medical disorders with the observed discoveries, offering a potential explanation for the occurrence of these disorders.
