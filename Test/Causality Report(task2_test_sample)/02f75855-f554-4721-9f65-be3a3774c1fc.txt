Causal Exploration: "The cardiothoracic ratio is found to be over 50, which is not in the normal range. This abnormality in the cardiac size and position is indicative of cardiomegaly. The cardiomegaly was found in the regions of 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Atrium', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Atrium', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Ventricle', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Ventricle'. This finding is supported by the location information given as {'begin': 8, 'end': 9}. Therefore, the causal exploration confirms the diagnosis of cardiomegaly."
