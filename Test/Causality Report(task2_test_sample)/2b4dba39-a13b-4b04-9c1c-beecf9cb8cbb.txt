With reference to A4, the word 'pleural effusion' is relevant to the part in A5 that states, ""When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting." This statement could be indicative of a pleural effusion condition, as it refers to a change in the costophrenic angle, which is a common indication of fluid build-up in the pleura, known as pleural effusion.

Therefore, the causal explanation integrating the findings of A1~4 could be as follows:

'Causal Exploration: The finding of a 'pleural effusion' (A1) in the 'Left Pleural' region (A2), specifically in the area between the 6th and 10th character of the medical report (A3), is likely causing the observed blunting of the costophrenic angle. The accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity can lead to a change in the shape and appearance of the costophrenic angle, often described as 'blunting'. Therefore, the statement in A5 about the blunting of the costophrenic angle is closely related to the pleural effusion finding in A4.'
