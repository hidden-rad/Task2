In A4, the terms 'cardiomegaly' and 'pleural effusion' are relevant to A5. Cardiomegaly refers to an enlarged heart, and pleural effusion refers to the buildup of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs. 

In A5, the statements related to cardiomegaly are: 
"When assess cardiac size, cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 and not in the normal range." This statement indicates a larger than normal heart, suggestive of cardiomegaly. 

The statements related to pleural effusion include: 
"When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is not blunted." A blunted costophrenic angle could indicate the presence of pleural effusion. 

Causal Exploration: 
The findings of A1~4 suggest the presence of cardiomegaly and pleural effusion. The location information in A2 and A3 show that these conditions are affecting the heart and the lower lobes of the lungs respectively. The causal explanation for these findings could be a variety of conditions. Cardiomegaly is often caused by high blood pressure or coronary artery disease. Pleural effusion could be caused by many medical conditions including pneumonia, tuberculosis, or lung cancer. The exact cause would need to be determined by further medical examination and testing. These conditions are serious and require medical attention.
