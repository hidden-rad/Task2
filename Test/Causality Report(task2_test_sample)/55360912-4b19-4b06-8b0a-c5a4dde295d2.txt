The relevant part in A4 (pneumonia) related to A5 is the statement "When compare the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones in turn, there is an abnormally increased density area." This statement indicates a sign of pneumonia, which is often characterized by increased lung density in imaging studies.

So, we can form the causal explanation as follows:

"Causal Exploration: The finding of pneumonia (A1) in the medical image is supported by the location information (A2 and A3), specifically in the Parenchyme, RUL(Right Upper Lobe), LLL(Left Lower Lobe), LUL(Left Upper Lobe), RLL(Right Lower Lobe), and RML(Right Middle Lobe). This is consistent with the observation in A5, where there is an abnormally increased density area in the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones of the lungs. This increased density is a typical sign of pneumonia, suggesting the presence of inflammation or infection in the lung tissue."
