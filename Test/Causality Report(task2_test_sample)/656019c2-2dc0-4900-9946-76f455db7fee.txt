The part in A4 relevant to A5 is 'granuloma'. Granuloma is a kind of inflammatory nodule, often small and benign, that can appear in various parts of the body including the lungs. 

In A1 we found a 'granuloma'. The location information of 'granuloma' was given in A2 as 'Etc', 'Left Hilum', and None. The exact location within this region was specified in A3 as beginning at the 5th position and ending at the 6th. 

Causal Explanation: 
The appearance of a granuloma in the 'Left Hilum' region could be due to various causes such as an inflammatory response to an infection or a foreign substance. It is a sign that the body is trying to wall off, contain or isolate something it perceives as foreign and harmful. This foreign substance could be a bacteria, fungus, parasite, or even an inhaled object or particle. The granuloma forms as a part of the body's immune response, as a way to prevent the spread of the foreign substance to other parts of the body. 

This explanation relates the findings of A1~A4 and provides a causal explanation for the finding of 'granuloma' at the specified location.
