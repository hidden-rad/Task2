Causal Exploration: Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs, which may fill with fluid. This could cause changes in the lungs such as abnormal increase in density area, asymmetry in the zones, or deviation in the trachea. The condition could also impact the bronchial tubes, possibly narrowing them or causing them to be cut off. Therefore, the abnormal findings could be explained by the presence of pneumonia.
