Based on the given information, we can say that the finding of 'pneumonia' (A1) has been discovered in different locations of the lung (A2), confirmed by the range of the words mentioning it (A3). This finding is relevant to the information provided in QA5, where it mentions the tracing of both main bronchi and the examination of both lungs. 

Causal Exploration: Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs, which may fill with fluid. In the context of the information in QA5, this could cause changes in the lungs such as abnormal increase in density area, asymmetry in the zones, or deviation in the trachea. The condition could also impact the bronchial tubes, possibly narrowing them or causing them to be cut off. Therefore, the abnormal findings in A1~4 could be explained by the presence of pneumonia.
