The relevant part in A4 to A5 is 'cardiomegaly'. The causal statement that relates the findings of A1~4 could be: 

"Causal Exploration: The finding of 'cardiomegaly' (A1) located in the 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Atrium', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Atrium', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Ventricle', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Ventricle' (A2) with the location information [{'begin': 6, 'end': 12}] (A3), indicates an abnormal enlargement of the heart. This condition could be due to several factors such as high blood pressure, heart valve disorders, or weakened heart muscle. In the provided radiological observations (A5), it was particularly noted that the 'cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 and not in the normal range', which is a common indicator of cardiomegaly."
