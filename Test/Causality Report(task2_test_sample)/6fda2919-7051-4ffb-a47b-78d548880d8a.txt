Causal Exploration: 

The finding of 'pleural effusion' (A1) in the location ['Pleural', 'Left Pleural', None] (A2) with specified position [{'begin': 2, 'end': 10}] (A3) can be causally linked to the observation in QA5 where the costophrenic angle is blunting. This is because pleural effusion, which is the accumulation of excess fluid in the pleural space, can cause the costophrenic angles (the angles between the ribs and the diaphragm) to appear blunt or less sharp on imaging. This is a common sign of pleural effusion and can help in the diagnosis and treatment of the condition. Therefore, the presence of pleural effusion can be a possible cause for the observed blunting of the costophrenic angle.
