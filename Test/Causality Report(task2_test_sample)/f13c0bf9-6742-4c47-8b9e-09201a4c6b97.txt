The part in A4 relevant to A5 is 'pleural effusion'. 

Causal Exploration: The finding of a pleural effusion (A1) is significant. This condition is located in the 'Pleural' or 'Right Pleural' areas (A2) and identified in the specific text range (A3). Pleural effusion refers to the buildup of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs. It's often associated with pneumonia, heart failure, liver disease, or kidney disease. 

In the context of the provided report (A5), the mention of "costophrenic angle is blunting" could be indicative of this condition. A blunted costophrenic angle is often a sign of pleural effusion. It is caused by the fluid accumulation in the pleural space, which obscures the sharp angle between the diaphragm and the chest wall. This could be the cause of the observed pleural effusion in this case. Further medical intervention may be required to drain the fluid and treat the underlying cause.
