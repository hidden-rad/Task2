In A4, the words 'pleural effusion' and 'pneumonia' are relevant to A5. 

'Pleural effusion' refers to the buildup of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs. In A5, it is stated, "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting." This could be a symptom of pleural effusion as the costophrenic angle, which is the angle between the diaphragm and the chest wall, can become blunted when fluid builds up.

'Pneumonia', on the other hand, is a lung infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. In A5, it is stated, "When compare the apical, upper, middle and lower zones in turn, there is no abnormally increased density area." This could indicate the absence of pneumonia as pneumonia often results in an increased density area in the lung.

Causal Exploration: The blunting of the costophrenic angle can be caused by a pleural effusion, which results from the buildup of excess fluid between the layers of the pleura outside the lungs. Similarly, the absence of an abnormally increased density area in the lungs could indicate the absence of pneumonia, a lung infection that inflames the air sacs in the lungs. These findings are based on the location information provided in A2 and A3.
