The part in A4 relevant to A5 is 'cardiomegaly'. 

In the context of A5, the detailed examination of the cardiac structures and surrounding areas such as the trachea, bronchi, lungs, and mediastinum revealed no abnormalities or deviations from the normal range. However, when assessing the cardiac size, the cardiothoracic ratio was found to be over 50, indicating an enlarged heart or cardiomegaly (A1).

The finding of cardiomegaly (A1) was confirmed by its location in the Mediastinum, specifically in the Middle Mediastinum(Heart), Left Ventricle, Right Ventricle, Left Atrium, and Right Atrium (A2). The precise location information was further specified as beginning at the 3rd and ending at the 12th position (A3).

Causal Explanation: Despite the normal findings in the surrounding structures, the enlargement of the heart (cardiomegaly) can be attributed to a variety of causes such as high blood pressure, heart valve disease, or diseases of the heart muscle. The enlargement can lead to further complications if not addressed promptly. 

Therefore, the findings of A1~4 indicate the presence of cardiomegaly and necessitate further investigation to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.
