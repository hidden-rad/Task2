The terms 'cardiomegaly', 'pleural effusion', and 'edema' are relevant. These terms are medical conditions that can be found in a patient upon examination and are related to the findings in the medical report. 

In 'Causal Exploration', we can say that:

1. 'Cardiomegaly' was found in the findings. The location of this finding is defined as 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Ventricle', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Ventricle'. The causal statement related to this is: "When assess cardiac size, cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 and not in the normal range.". This indicates that the heart is larger than normal, which is a characteristic of cardiomegaly.

2. 'Pleural effusion' was found in the findings. The location of this finding is defined as 'Pleural', 'Left Pleural', 'Pleural', 'Right Pleural'. The causal statement related to this is: "When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is not blunted.". This indicates the presence of fluid in the pleural space, which is a characteristic of pleural effusion.

3. 'Edema' was found in the findings. The location of this finding is not specifically defined, but it generally occurs in the parenchyma of the lungs. The causal statement related to this is: "When both lungs should be well expanded and similar in volume, one lung is not prominently larger than the other.". This indicates the presence of excess fluid in the lungs, which is a characteristic of edema.

These causal statements explain the presence of these conditions in the patient and provide a basis for further medical investigation and treatment.
