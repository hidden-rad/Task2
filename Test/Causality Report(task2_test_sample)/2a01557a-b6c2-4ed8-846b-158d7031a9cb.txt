Causal Exploration: The atelectasis identified in the left lower lobe of the lung is likely the cause of the asymmetry in lung volume observed. This condition has caused one lung to be smaller than the other, leading to potential respiratory complications. Further investigation is necessary to confirm this hypothesis and determine appropriate treatment.
