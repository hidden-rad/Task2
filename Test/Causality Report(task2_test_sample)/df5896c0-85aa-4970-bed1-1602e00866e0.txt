Causal Exploration: 'Pneumonia' is a condition that triggers inflammation in the air sacs of the lungs, potentially leading to these sacs being filled with fluid or pus. This results in symptoms such as coughing, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. The presence of this condition can be identified by examining the trachea down to the carina for any deviations. It may also be noticeable when comparing the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones sequentially, as an unusually dense area may be discovered due to the fluid or pus. 

Conversely, 'Atelectasis' is a condition where the air sacs in the lungs either collapse or fail to inflate correctly. This is observable when both lungs, which should be similarly expanded and voluminous, show a discrepancy with one lung not being significantly larger than the other. Additionally, when examining both main bronchi, the bronchial may appear narrowed or severed due to the air sacs' collapse.

Both these conditions can lead to alterations in the normal functioning of the lungs, which may be evident in certain findings. Therefore, it is essential to use the location information of these findings to accurately diagnose these conditions.
