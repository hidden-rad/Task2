Causal Exploration: The discovery of 'pleural effusion' situated in the 'Left Pleural' area, as suggested by the positional data, is causally linked to the blunting of the costophrenic angle. This radiological sign, frequently seen when the lateral margins of the lung are traced to the costophrenic angles, implies an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. This is in line with the diagnosis of pleural effusion.
