Causal Explanation: 

The discovery of 'cardiomegaly' was found in the medical record, specifically located in the 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Atrium', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Left Atrium', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', 'Right Ventricle', 'Mediastinum', 'Middle Mediastinum(Heart)', and 'Left Ventricle'. The location information of the finding was denoted as [{'begin': 5, 'end': 11}]. The enlargement of the heart, or 'cardiomegaly', can cause significant changes in the structure and function of the heart and surrounding areas. According to the descriptions, the cardiothoracic ratio is over 50 and not in the normal range, suggesting a potential enlargement of the heart. This can lead to various symptoms and complications, including shortness of breath, swelling (edema), and irregular heart rhythm, which may be reflected in the patient's medical record.
