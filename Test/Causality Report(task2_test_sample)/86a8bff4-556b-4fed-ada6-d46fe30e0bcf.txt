The relevant part in A4 ('emphysema') to A5 is the statement "When review the upper abdomen, soft tissues and take a look at some final check areas, there is no subcutaneous emphysema."

Causal Explanation:

In the medical findings denoted as A1, emphysema was identified. The location information of this finding, as denoted in A2 and A3, suggests that it is present in various areas of the lungs and diaphragm. However, when reviewing the upper abdomen and soft tissues (as mentioned in A5), there is no sign of subcutaneous emphysema. This suggests that the emphysema (A4) is localized to the lungs and has not spread to other areas such as the upper abdomen. This could be due to early detection or effective disease management. Further analysis and tests may be required to determine the exact cause and progression of the emphysema.
