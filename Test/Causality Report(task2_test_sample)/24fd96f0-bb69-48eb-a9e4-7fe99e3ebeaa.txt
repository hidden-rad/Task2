Causal Exploration: 1. Pneumonia: The discovery of pneumonia in the initial report is associated with certain observations in the final analysis such as "there is an abnormally increased density area." and "it is asymmetrical.". This is due to the infection in the lung parenchyme as indicated in the secondary report. The location of the infection as provided by the tertiary report potentially indicates the pneumonia in RLL(Right Lower Lobe), LUL(Left Upper Lobe), LLL(Left Lower Lobe) and RUL(Right Upper Lobe).

2. Pleural Effusion: The evidence of pleural effusion in the initial report is linked to the observations in the final analysis like "costophrenic angle is not blunted.". This is due to the excess fluid in the pleural space as indicated in the secondary report. The location data provided by the tertiary report potentially indicates the pleural effusion in the lung parenchyme. 

So, in conclusion, the symptoms and diagnostic findings in the initial, secondary, and tertiary reports are consistent with the conditions of pneumonia and pleural effusion as explained in the final analysis.
