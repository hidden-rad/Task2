Causal Exploration: 

The presence of pneumonia can lead to asymmetrically distributed areas of increased density in the lungs, which is a finding commonly observed. This is due to the inflammation and consolidation that occur in the lung tissue during pneumonia. The location information indicates that these changes can occur in any lobe of the lung, but are typically most prevalent in the lower lobes. This can be seen in the distribution of findings in the Parenchyme and the Right Lower Lobe (RLL). 

Additionally, the range suggested indicates that these changes can be widespread, affecting a large portion of the lung. The causal relationship here is that the inflammation and infection of pneumonia cause changes in the lung tissue that can be observed on medical imaging, leading to the commonly observed findings. 

For 'pleural effusion', fluid accumulates in the pleural space, which can cause one lung to appear prominently larger than the other, a commonly observed finding. The location of this finding can be anywhere in the Pleura. The range of this effusion can vary. 

Lastly, 'atelectasis' refers to a partial or complete collapse of the lung, which can cause an asymmetrical appearance or abnormally increased density area in the lung, common findings. This can occur in any part of the lung, with the Parenchyme and the Right Middle Lobe (RML) being possible locations. The range of this condition can also vary. 

In conclusion, the presence of pneumonia, pleural effusion, and atelectasis can explain the commonly observed findings, providing a causal explanation for the observed symptoms.
