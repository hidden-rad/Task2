Based on the given information, the relevant part in A4 (['pleural effusion']) that relates to A5 is 'pleural effusion'. Pleural effusion is a condition characterized by abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, which is the cavity between the lungs and the chest wall. 

The causal statement linking the findings of A1-A4 could be: 

"Causal Explanation: The presence of pleural effusion identified in A1 is located in the areas specified in A2 ('Pleural', 'Right Pleural', None, 'Pleural', 'Left Pleural', None). This was determined using the location information provided in A3, which indicates the beginning and end of the finding. In the context of A5, the statement 'When trace the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, costophrenic angle is blunting.' could be indicative of the presence of pleural effusion, as blunting of the costophrenic angle can be a sign of this condition. Therefore, the findings suggest that the patient may have pleural effusion." 

Please note that this is a hypothetical interpretation and further medical investigations are required for a confirmed diagnosis.
