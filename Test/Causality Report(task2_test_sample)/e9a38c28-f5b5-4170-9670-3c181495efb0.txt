The part in A4 relevant to A5 is the presence of 'pneumothorax' and 'mass'. 

The causal statement could be as follows: 

Causal Explanation: The presence of 'pneumothorax' and 'mass' as identified in A1 can be related to the abnormal findings in A2 and A3. The abnormalities in the 'Parenchyme', 'RUL(Right Upper Lobe)', 'RML(Right Middle Lobe)', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)', and 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)' can possibly be due to the effects of the 'pneumothorax' and 'mass'. This may have caused a disparity in the lung volumes, asymmetry in the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones, and abnormalities in the hilum and lung vessels as stated in A5. Further investigation is needed to confirm this.
