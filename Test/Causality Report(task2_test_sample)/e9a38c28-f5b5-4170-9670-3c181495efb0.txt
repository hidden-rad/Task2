Causal Exploration: The presence of 'pneumothorax' and 'mass' can be related to the abnormal findings. The abnormalities in the 'Parenchyme', 'RUL(Right Upper Lobe)', 'RML(Right Middle Lobe)', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', 'LUL(Left Upper Lobe)', and 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)' can possibly be due to the effects of the 'pneumothorax' and 'mass'. This may have caused a disparity in the lung volumes, asymmetry in the apical, upper, middle, and lower zones, and abnormalities in the hilum and lung vessels. Further investigation is needed to confirm this.
