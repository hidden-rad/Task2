Causal Exploration: The atelectasis found in the 'Parenchyme', 'RUL(Right Upper Lobe)', 'RLL(Right Lower Lobe)', and 'LLL(Left Lower Lobe)' could be the cause for the observed uneven expansion of the lungs and increased density in certain areas, as described in A5. The collapsed or deflated air sacs in these areas due to atelectasis can lead to reduced lung volume and increased density on imaging.
