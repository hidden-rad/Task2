In the given list, the terms 'interstitial lung disease', 'cardiomegaly', and 'pneumonia' are relevant to the conditions mentioned in the list. Each of these terms is associated with specific symptoms and findings listed.

For instance, 'interstitial lung disease' is often characterized by 'asymmetrical lung zones' and 'abnormally increased density area' in the lungs, which are mentioned in the list. Similarly, 'cardiomegaly' is related to some of the symptoms listed such as 'the heart position is not located on 1/3 the right side and 2/3 on the left side' and 'cardiothoracic ratio does not exceed 50 and is in the normal range'. Lastly, 'pneumonia' can be associated with 'no extra lines in the periphery that are not blood vessels' and 'costophrenic angle is not blunted'.

In terms of the causal explanation, the findings can be used to explain the occurrence of these conditions. For example, the occurrence of 'interstitial lung disease' could be due to abnormal changes in the parenchyma and the location of these changes in the lobes. This corresponds to the findings. The same can be said for 'cardiomegaly' and 'pneumonia'. 

Therefore, the 'Causal Exploration' can be stated as follows:

The interstitial lung disease, cardiomegaly, and pneumonia identified are caused by abnormalities in the parenchyma located in various lobes. These abnormalities are characterized by the findings listed, which include asymmetrical lung zones, abnormally increased density area, abnormal heart position, and other symptoms. These findings, combined with the location information and the identified abnormalities, provide a comprehensive causal explanation for the conditions listed.
