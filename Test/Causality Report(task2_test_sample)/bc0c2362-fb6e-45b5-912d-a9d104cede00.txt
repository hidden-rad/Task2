From the given information, the aspect in A4 that is relevant to A5 is 'pleural effusion'. This is a medical condition where there is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, the cavity between the lung and the chest wall.

The causal statement relating the findings of A1~4 in a causal explanation could be:

"Causal Exploration: The presence of the pleural effusion (A1) identified in the left pleural region (A2) within the given location information (A3) may have resulted in the observed blunting of the costophrenic angle in the chest scan (A5). The accumulation of fluid can cause the costophrenic angle, the angle between the rib cage and the diaphragm, to appear blunted or less sharp than normal. This is a common sign of pleural effusion. Further diagnostic procedures are recommended to confirm this finding and determine the underlying cause of the effural effusion (A4)."
