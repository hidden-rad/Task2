Causal Exploration: The presence of the pleural effusion identified in the left pleural region within the given location information may have resulted in the observed blunting of the costophrenic angle in the chest scan. The accumulation of fluid can cause the costophrenic angle, the angle between the rib cage and the diaphragm, to appear blunted or less sharp than normal. This is a common sign of pleural effusion. Further diagnostic procedures are recommended to confirm this finding and determine the underlying cause of the effural effusion.
