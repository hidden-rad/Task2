Causal Exploration: The discovery of 'pleural effusion' found in the location of the 'Pleural', 'Right Pleural', and unspecified areas can be linked to the statement 'When tracing the lateral margins of the lung to the costophrenic angles, the costophrenic angle is blunting.' This implies that the accumulation of excess fluid is causing the costophrenic angle to blunt, a common indication of pleural effusion.
